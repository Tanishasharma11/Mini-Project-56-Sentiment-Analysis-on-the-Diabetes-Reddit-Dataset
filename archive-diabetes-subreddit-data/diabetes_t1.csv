Heartbroken fuck being diabetic,"So long story short I was diagnosed dka t1 couple weeks ago. Me and my now ex girlfriend are no longer together, we were together for over 4 years. And what she told me broke my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π we‚Äôve always talked about getting married and having kids etc I loved this girl with all my heart but these past couple weeks have been rough. I have a really hard time poking myself with needles so I‚Äôve been getting her to help me, but these past week she‚Äôs been more distant then ever .      she told me that she didn‚Äôt sign up for this like i wanted to become diabetic in the first place . one argument lead to another and she said she doesn‚Äôt even want kids with me anymore because they will be diabetic aswell and she doesn‚Äôt want a sick kid ¬ø I lost my shit and told her I don‚Äôt ever want to see her again because there is no future with her if that‚Äôs her thought process . I don‚Äôt deserve to be put down because of a disease that I randomly got ( first one to get it in my family ) I haven‚Äôt talked to her in a week and she been trying to apologize but I don‚Äôt wanna hear it I told her we‚Äôre done because what was said really hurt me and I can‚Äôt look at her the same  did I do the right thing ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14pr1tp/heartbroken_fuck_being_diabetic/,"['She doesn‚Äôt deserve you if her reaction was ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sign up for this‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ honestly dodged a bullet.

I don‚Äôt think anyone sets out to have a ‚Äúsick‚Äù child, but to be frank, no one is guaranteed a healthy able bodied child and those are considerations that people should make before they decide to forge ahead with having children. But also, you dodged a huge bullet if that‚Äôs how she deals with life issues. I personally would forgive her and forget I ever knew her. Good luck!', 'Fuck her and her weird eugenics bullshit. Even with diabetes, life is worth living. You‚Äôre not going to be a burden on the world, you‚Äôre going to contribute to it like everyone else. You dodged a bullet.

Bad shit happens to everyone, it's just a matter of time. When you raise a child with someone, you have to trust that they will be there for you and your child. She has clearly shown that she will give up or not help when it is inconvenient for her.\n\nMy son is 6 and was just diagnosed with T1D. Thankfully, his mother and I are willing to do whatever it takes to keep him healthy. I have seen too many couples learn that one of them is a selfish, heartless piece of shit *after* their child was born.

You now have to opportunity to find someone better."", ""You dodged a hardcore bullet, buddy. In this case, diabetes is the wingman that freed you from harpy of epic proportions. Cut her out.

You need someone who is going to support you, no matter what. For her to prefer to be in a relationship with someone who isn't able to be well is a red flag.\n\nI was married for 4 years prior to my diagnosis. I say this because the side-effects of my uncontrolled (and undiagnosed) hyperglycemia was a major point of contention in our marriage. Low sex drive, exhaustion at the end of the day, waking her up cause I had to pee 4x a night for years, atrophy, etc... It wasn't until the diagnosis came along that we were actually able to start repairing our relationship. We didn't know there was a 3rd partner in our relationship. Recognizing that hidden partner ultimately led to us learning which tools were needed to make things better. In short, the diagnosis, while very traumatic in itself, is a blessing to the victim and the ones they surround themselves with."", 'So, I was dx\'d while pregnant with my high school boyfriend. We ended up getting married and having another kid. We were together from my age 15-30. He knew me before dx and was absolutely unsupportive of my health the entire time (comparing me to other people (read:T2D who have very little in common with T1D), never going to a Dr\'s appointment,  complaining about the cost of insulin, so on and so forth). He also ""didn\'t sign up for this"" ONLY HE DID. I won\'t forget how I was treated and my family won\'t forgive it. \nMy next boyfriend was better support but my health did come into play. What were to happen during pregnancy (my pregnancies in my 20s were horrendous, what would it be like in my 30s? What if I have a seizure with a newborn?). But in my opinion, these are valid questions and as just a boyfriend, it would have been ok for him to back out of the relationship.  I really don\'t fault and it sucked at the time...but if he didn\'t support me when I was still healthy, what would have happened if I did lose my vision or my feet? I think the resentment would have just kept snowballing. Again, while it was painful, it was alright. \n\nMy current boyfriend just accepts diabetes as a part of me as much as my eye color. He loves me for me and we deal with my health as needed. I\'ve never felt more supported- which leads me to take better care of myself, which allows me to move forward in my career and be the parent I want to be.\n\nAll of this is a long-winded way to say, once you find the right person, everything will fall into place. And for the wrong people, they can fuck right off.', ""Been with my girlfriend for 4 years and never had this issue I once passed out with a high after I had taken some insulin and she watched over me and contacted my friends to make sure she didn't need to do anything extra as she had never met someone with type 1"", 'I hope all works out as the best situation for you. It does suck that what we feel is true love may be covered in shallow, selfish package. Cheers to your health and love life.', 'If that was her reaction, then she doesn‚Äôt have the empathy required to have children. What is she going to do when her kid doesn‚Äôt come out perfect? Because they won‚Äôt. Say I didn‚Äôt sign up for this and abandon them? \n\nMy kid is the T1. Did I expect this? No. Am I sad my child has to deal with this? Yes. Did I know or even think this would happen? No. \n\nBut I sure as shit signed up for it. I signed up to be his mom and I signed up for the good the bad and the ugly. And this isn‚Äôt always pretty. \n\nAnd if my son came to me and told me his girlfriend said that I would tell him at least she showed her ass now. \n\nYou deserve someone who will go through it with you and be your partner, support system and cheerleader in all things. All the beautiful and ugly aspects of life. She‚Äôs not that someone.', 'Look at it this way. You dodged a MASSIVE bullet. This person was never the right one. Everyone gets old, sick, and has difficulties. She left at the slightest whiff of real life. You will find a partner someday who supports you through your illness, and one upside of our illness is it brings out the best in people too. Someday your bond will deepen with a wonderful person because they accept this and help you. And you will experience the deep contentment of knowing you are truly loved.\n\nHang in there my dear friend.', 'Dodged a bullet. You don‚Äôt want someone who won‚Äôt not only stand with you, but be a source of support during hardship. \n\nAlso, you never know what you‚Äôre going to get with kids.

And now you are wrong for not allowing her the chance to apologize / explain how she felt.  Maybe she realizes how selfish she sounded after time to reflect?  My work is with cancer patients.

You deserve better.', 'could be worse... at least you heard the truth early vs discovering the lies decades later', 'Well... this was a hard pill to swallow even for me just reading this post. \n\nAs a human being i hope you can stay strong in your decission to end this relationship, for your own good, if there is no other things that could balance this in her favour. \n\nI will short tell you my story. This month will be 3 years since my diagnosis. I am still learning and adapting because i was one year and a half only on glucometer and pens, after that sensors and pens and now im 3 months with pump. Looking back, a lot of adjustments that made diabetes the central point of my life and fear to give my best at work to not get fired. \n\nGoing back to the impact that the diagnosis has on my relationship, at first, he seemed scared and became ipohondric. After one year, we had tickets for a big music festival and i went 1st day, the 2nd my bgs were really bad and only suggesting that i might not go i have started a ""fire"" and heard things like, i am ruining other people s plans and like i was an obstacle for people. I really felt this is not something i could ever forgive... i was like sorry if my diabetes bothers you so much...\n\nI went to therapy. The therapist told me if i have ever asked him how did he felt my diagnosis, because he was caring and supportive for a while and i felt very selfish as i realised that it didnt occur to me. As diabetes is not only our diagnosis, is a fear that impacts all people that have love for us. Maybe in some way was better for me as i had to be the one in control. \n\nNevertheless, almost 3 years later he has no respect for many things diabetes related... as my sleep...this is a constant reason to fight... i an sorry i didnt end it after that festival.\n\nIm telling you this because i dont know your gf, maybe she reacted out of fear, and totally messed up with you...or maybe you are in my shoes too and need to hear that people dont change. \n\nPeople with diabetes that i know they live a happy life have caring and supportive partners, that show understanding and makes them feel less lonely...', 'Yes.

I would say it‚Äôs time to move on unfortunately', 'A lot of times when we are diagnosed we lose a bunch of weight. Seems like you lost a good bit that will hopefully come back as someone else that is worthy of you. I‚Äôm sorry you had to see her awful side, but better now than married with kids. You‚Äôll get there, it will just be with someone better and more worthy of you. \n\nAlso just a side note, if shots are a difficult you can try insulin pens or a pump. So much easier than shots. \n\nI am sorry for your loss. Sometimes we have to deal with crap to get to better times. You will get there.', 'She‚Äôs not worth your time! Yes, you did the right thing in dumping her!  Diabetes is a horrible disease and if she can‚Äôt handle you giving insulin every day, then she sure won‚Äôt be able to handle any future complications you might get from having diabetes!

I will straight up tell you, I would‚Äôve done the same thing as you. \nTo play devils advocate, it could‚Äôve just been a moment of frustration. If she‚Äôs helping you out a ton, she too might be overwhelmed and scared.\nBut flip it- if she ended up being diagnosed would you have felt the same way towards her? Doubtful. To say she doesn‚Äôt want to have kids with you because they‚Äôll be sick too is just plain cruel.\n\nSorry that it happened to you because it shouldn‚Äôt have but better now than way late. PS don‚Äôt worry. When you‚Äôre ready to get back out there, there are going to be plenty of people who won‚Äôt even bat an eye when you tell them you‚Äôre diabetic.  The good ones never do. If they do, easy red flag and you know what to do!\n\nEdit to add: type 1 gets a lot easier the longer you have it and while none of us will ever be experts you‚Äôll learn how your body will likely do something and it won‚Äôt feel like a burden forever.

This group is helpful though tbh.\n\nNext, sorry about your girlfriend, that‚Äôs some high stress to add to the whole thing. As others said, people say wild things when under a lot of stress, even unforgivable things imo can be forgiven. I have no idea the relationship y‚Äôall have or had, but another tenet of long term relationships is not holding onto words, especially said out of anger/stress/fear. It happens. Even if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt reconcile, best let it go either way. People don‚Äôt start out enlightened, it takes life experience sometimes, and maybe she hasn‚Äôt had those experiences yet.

The Unthinkable Happened,"Last Friday, my boss asked me to start only doing my diabetes care in bathrooms while working. I never thought I'd be asked to hide or keep the disease a secret. Apparently changing pump supplies and doing treatment (shots/testing when needed) makes people uncomfortable.

Some background: I work as a Phlebotomist for big-name lab company (it's one of the two you're probably thinking of). My job asks me to go into doctor's offices and collect samples, and I guess one of the offices was offended by me doing the normal pump supplies stuffs.

Their bathrooms are always dirty, without sharps containers, and for public use. While just in general gross, it's unsanitary to use those facilities for that purpose. Not to mention the ADA requirements being broken, and an approved reasonable accomodation from my HR department. 

What makes me the most upset is the thought that MY disability is making OTHERS uncomfortable. Like it just makes me feel like crap, and different when all I've done is work to get to a healthy A1C, weight, and normal life somewhat.

Insulin Warm Upon Delivery,"I get my insulin (Humalog pens, 90-day supply) through Express Scripts. They ship the insulin in a foam cooler with ice packs, and prior to this summer, there were no issues. However, my last two deliveries arrived warm (melted ice packs and hotter-than-room temperature inside the cooler). It‚Äôs been 90+ degrees here, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs much warmer on the delivery truck. After the first delivery, I called ES immediately (after putting the insulin in the refrigerator) and spoke to a pharmacist who assured me the insulin would be fine. My endocrinologist was skeptical and told me to keep a close eye on my blood sugar. Sure enough, within two weeks of using this insulin, I started having random, sustained highs. I contacted ES and complained again. They shipped out a replacement and it arrived today. Warm again.

"Hello, Im new here","TL'DR. Im new here. An observations it took me 30 years to realise. Total Calories determine Basal dosage. Changes to average daily calorie intake will cause ""unexplained"" highs and lows.

Hi all,

I'm new here so thought I'd introduce myself. 46 YO male, had T1D since 1990 at age 12.

I'm old school and still inject. Tresiba and Humalog but just added Fiasp to see how that works (and not sure it's any improvement on Humalog tbh). I use Libre 2. My control is good, maybe even excellent. My sister is T1D too (awesome family genetics) but she became T1 10 years ago.

I'm 94% on target on the Libre standard target, but I set my own target of 4mmol to 7.9mmol (72 to 142 for my North American cousins) and aim for 75% minimum and I get annoyed if it drops below that (god damn you any low reading Libre sensors, DO NOT F\*\*\* with my stats) . I've hit 78% of the last 3 months at 6.6mmol average and thats a few % better than usual.

I lift weights a few times a week and have been doing so for many years. This helps T1D in the long run, but nighttime after leg day can mean alarms and jelly babies. That double-edged sword of diabetes and exercise.

I don‚Äôt post online re diabetes or read that much either online about it but I thought to post this observation I've made over the last couple of years which has helped me and my sister. This is my experience. I'm not claiming this is science in any way, but from the little I do see online re T1D I don‚Äôt recall seeing this discussed. If it has been and is common knowledge apologies. Due to the fact that I inject a basal and bolus injection, it may not be relevant to other treatment regimens, or it might be.

I started to track everything I ate a couple of years ago in MyFitnessPal which was more for body composition/weight training but obviously benefits diabetes. I eventually realised my blood glucose levels jumped up or down the day or 2 after if I had eaten more or less than my average calories.

Eg, I‚Äôm aiming for 2600 calories and usually I'm within 200 calories either side of that, all is fine. But If I have a weekend and eat 3000, 3400 calories for a day or 2 then the days after my glucose would be high. The more calories the higher. And vice versa, If I had a day and was several 100 cals below my usual then id have more hypos.

I realised Basal is to calories what a Bolus is to carbs, albeit over a longer timescale.

My Tresiba ratio is 1unit per 100 calories. This varies on how much fat I carry, the season/ temperature, any exercise regime changes/ stress/sleep levels, but 100 calories per 1u is an appropriate guide for me. Two months ago I began  a fat loss diet (i do this a least yearly). Prior to that I‚Äôd been eating in a calorie surplus for a while, around 2800 calories average, while my basal ranged from 28 to 33 units.

Then I switched to a calorie controlled diet for 2 months to lose some fat. I titrated down to 19 units at 1900 calories a day.

A few days ago I began a break from the diet and consumed about 500 calories above the 1900 calorie diet average. Then the next day 4000 calories (beer, snacks, fatty foods). I‚Äôve already had to increase my tresiba from 19 to 23 units as yesterday my glucose spiked like  I've not seen in the last few months. I didn‚Äôt do anything unusual on the day it was spiking (actually ate lowish calories/carbs), it was spiking because my basal dose wasn‚Äôt high enough to cope with the increase in calories in the previous 2 days. My target calories during my diet break are 2400 so I know that 23-24 units of Tresiba should do the trick whilst on the diet break. Then when I go back onto the diet and I know I'll hot 1900 calories i'll lower basal to 19u to avoid hypos that would happen leaving basal at 24 but lowering calories to 1900.

I‚Äôve experienced this over and over in the last couple of years. Sometimes I can predict it and adjust before hand without them experiencing highs or lows. Sometimes not so accurate or a bit too hasty with changes.

Another observation. My body handles carbs easier when fat is relatively low ( 20% or less of total calories). I consumed between 350g to 400g of carbs daily during my calorie surplus. This is a decent amount for T1 however my BG was 4mmol and 7.9mmol (72 to 142) 75% of the time over 3 months and more. In the past few years, I have kept within my 4 to 7.9mmol 75% target and usually 94% target (4 to 10mmol).

There‚Äôs loads of info out there on how to control your diabetes but Im not sure this calorie / basal observation gets discussed. I could be wrong, I‚Äôm sure others have figured this out. However, I think it‚Äôs worth repeating as I think it can have a significant contribution to the impact of unexplained highs and lows and if sometimes calorie intake varies a lot day to day (like my sister) it may help understand the changes in BG readings that you then chase and get in to a glucose doom loop; eat, go high, rage bolus, go low, repeat. Keeping calories stable can help keep the basal stable and your glusone more predictable and less reactionary.

I hope this help someone out.

My HBA1C shows as 44mmol on the images whereas the phone app shows 39mmol and my blood test HB1AC is 39. Different Libre reports seem to have slightly different stats.

Cheers if you read this loooong post and hope you have a good day

I personally have hated almost every Endo I‚Äôve ever had, with one exception. My current Endo stays out of my business, prescribes what I want, runs the labs I ask for, and doesn‚Äôt pretend like she‚Äôs the one responsible for my successes and failures.

"Type 1, fitness and, cortisol","I'm currently using cortisol nose spray for a chronic infection in my nose and working out semi regularly. 
So, today I got the following issue: before I go to the gym I ready a slice of bread (according to my experience and estimates it should raise the blood sugar to about 200 mg/dl). So I read about cortisol that it can raise the bg level. So, everything looked fine, until the bg did not stop rising and currently it is at about 300.

Did I simply miscalculate out is it the cortisol? Does anyone have experience with that sorta stuff? 

Thanx people ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14pme54/type_1_fitness_and_cortisol/,"[""Nobody can answer that with certainty, because there are simply too many variables at play, but here's my take.  \n\nCortisol and all corticosteroids result in increased insulin resistance.  That applies to basal insulin as well as bolus insulin, so it would affect your blood sugar no matter whether you normally injected insulin before your workout or simply relied on basal insulin already present in your system to account for the bread and keep your blood sugar at around 200.  \n\nI would be willing to guess that it was probably the cortisol spray, especially if this is the first time you've used it and this is the first time this has happened, although it could also be in part your body's natural reaction to the inflammation in your nasal passages that you're using the cortisol for in the first place.  That inflammation can cause insulin resistance as well.""]"
Is this illegal?,"So I was going to a casino with a friend in the UK (I know bad idea but whatever!) and on entry all my bags are checked by security.

I explain the situation and why it is needed and a manager comes. After about 5 mins of checking every single pocket of my bag- he tells me I can go in, but only if I leave my bag outside.

Questions about low blood sugar,"Hello Everyone, first time poster.  
i've had diabetes since I was 3 and will be turning 31 soon. So i've had experience with it for a very long time. However there is so much of it that feels like a mystery.

&#x200B;

I take Lantus for my night shot and humalog kwikpen on a 10 gram carb scale, and 1 unit for every 50 units of glucose above 150.

&#x200B;

I woke up last night around 3 am because my freestyle libre alerted me that my blood sugar was high. It was 257. Now the libre isn't always accurate and some of this is my fault for not pricking myself to get a more accurate reading. I was just very groggy and not thinking. I gave myself 2 units of humalog.  An hour later my blood sugar dropped. I usually have those welch fruit snacks when my blood sugar drops. Each packet is about 17 grams of carbs. Well Last night I had to eat about 9 servings just to stabilize it.  Can anyone explain why I had to eat about 170 grams of carbs to get my glucose up when I only injected myself 2 units? Maybe I'm missing something but it doesn't add up to me. It leaves me very frustrated.

Pump choice,"Hi all!

I am finally deciding to get a pump, and looking for one that will be integrated with a CGM.

My endo provided me with two options: the tslim x2 that goes with the dexcom g6, or the minimed 780g that goes with the guardian 3 (soon to be guardian 4).

I just wanted to see if any of you had advice or experience with these that you'd like to share to help me make my decision! 

I have an appointment with pump specialists next week as well to get more understanding of the basics :)

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14plko7/pump_choice/,"['Your endo forgot option #3, OmniPod 5 with Dexcom.  OmniPod is tubeless and for some people that‚Äôs important.  Others don‚Äôt care about the tubing.\n\nYou will get many responses telling you to stay away from Medtronic.  Many people have had bad experiences with their sensors, and the algorithm on their older pumps wasn‚Äôt very good.  They just came out with the 780g & Guardian 4 sensors but not many people in the United States have gotten it yet so you won‚Äôt see much about it yet.  The Guardian 4 sensors do not require daily calibrations.  It‚Äôs been available in Europe for a couple of years and people seem to really like the 780g there.\n\nTandem‚Äôs Control IQ is better than the old Medtronic algorithm, but again you won‚Äôt see many comparisons to the 780g yet.  Tandem works based off your own settings while Medtronic is supposed to learn your needs and adjust everything on its own.  OmniPod 5 is similar in that it is supposed to learn your needs, but it only adjusts basal and will not do automatic corrections like Tandem and Medtronic.  OmniPod also holds only 200 units, while the others hold 300.  There is quite a bit of insulin waste with Tandem so after filling the tubing and not being able to use around 20-25 units in the cartridge you have about 250-260 units you can actually use if you fill it completely.  That‚Äôs important only if you have higher insulin requirements.\n\nSo, you will see many recommendations for Tandem.  It‚Äôs a great pump, Dexcom is a great sensor and much easier to apply than Medtronic which requires putting tape over the whole thing after inserting.  Tandem is also smaller and sleeker and has a touch screen vs Medtronic‚Äôs chunky block of plastic and lots of button pressing.', 'It‚Äôs going to come down to personal preference. They all have pros and cons. \n\nSomeone else mentioned Omnipod 5 as well, which is also closed loop. \n\nMy advice is to do some homework. Read about the different pumps. Watch some YouTube reviews. The best ones are the ones that can tell you why the do or don‚Äôt like a particular pump, and then you can decide if that applies to you.', 'For me, personally, I can‚Äôt stand Medtronic‚Äôs CGM. I haven‚Äôt tried the Minimed 780g but I used Medtronic pumps back when they were just Minimed, before Medtronic bought them. Back in the day, they were the best. But I think over the years they have slipped. Dexcom G6 is a far superior CGM, in my experience. Last year I finally made the switch from Medtronic to Omnipod 5 and Dexcom G6, absolutely love it. Tandem was my next choice but I wanted to try tubeless.']"

I know being sick i need to increase my insulin, but this sickness has been absolutely brutal and it seems my needs increase more everyday. my basal insulin has increased by 70% and i have to give myself 5x more my normal bolus only to end up at the higher end of bgs after a meal. I‚Äôve been eating smaller amount of carbs because i can‚Äôt deal with the highs, and for a normal 15g carb meal, which i normally give 1 unit now needs 5 units, plus 2-4 correction for the next couple of hours. 

it seems every day i get better i need more insulin. i feel like i‚Äôm fully recovered except for this dry cough so i‚Äôm wondering when this resistance, if that‚Äôs what it is, will go back to normal?

Blood sugar randomly jumping hours after eating,"Anyone have an idea what is going on?  Last few days, 2-4 hours after I eat, my BS goes from stable 120-140 jumping to 300 with tons of insulin thrown on top with nothing happening to stop the rise/drop it for an hour or more.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

I also always bring 2-3 times as many snacks as I think I'll need, and I bring a mix of fast acting sugar like smarties and glucose tabs, and slower acting like granola bars or peanut butter crackers. The trouble with just relying on glucose tabs is that they'll pop you up quick but won't necessarily keep you there; you need something with more substance to keep you up.\n\nAnd yes, it sucks having to carry all this extra shit around with me. I feel paranoid, and like I'm old before my time always traveling with all this stuff and checking and double checking to make sure I have all my supplies on me.

T1D parent. Is CGM and pump absolutely necessary?,"My son was diagnosed when he was 2. He‚Äôs 5 now and about to start elementary school this fall. His endo keeps pressuring me to force him to wear a Dexcom so he can eventually get an insulin pump. My son has sensory issues and is really scared of getting the Dexcom. I also want him to learn to manage his diabetes manually before even thinking about using any technology. The nurse at his school says she‚Äôs comfortable with doing everything manually and we live super close to school in case I need to go help. I don‚Äôt work so I‚Äôll be available while he‚Äôs at school. We‚Äôve been managing his blood sugar just fine so far without it. So, question is, is there anyone who has managed their T1D long-term without a cgm or pump? Or is it absolutely necessary to use these things? 

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ow288/t1d_parent_is_cgm_and_pump_absolutely_necessary/,"['Slightly different take- its not about getting your kid under good (or better) control with the CGM- its about the utter lack of control with school IMO.  Schedules in school are wild and can and will change without much communication to parents.   Extra recess bc its beautiful out, double up on PE bc the art teacher is out sick, not to mention recess is typically after lunch (and thus activates the kids insulin extra hard.). At 5- your child may or may not be able to communicate his schedule to you and why he dropped- but also hypoglycemia can come on FAST.  The nurse might mean well and think she‚Äôs comfortable- but in my experience with my kid- the school system has only ever had superficial knowledge of Type 1.  Also- schools have SOOO much extra food for all sorts of nonsense reasons and its nice to be able to have the kid (or teacher) shoot a text asking if its ok to eat xyz today and see the glucose and trend and ok (or deny) so they arent always left out (or having to delay and go to office etc).  \n\nThe pump decision can take or leave when (or if) your kid and you decide he‚Äôs ready‚Ä¶.its really independent of the CGM.

Many people with diabetes did it a long time. And if the BG levels are good and your son feels fine, that is really amazing.\n\n With the CGM I really would recommend to just try it out. It is pretty much the best thing you can have as t1diabetic and if you have the option, persuade your son to give it a try. It really doesn't hurt. Alternatively the Libre sensor is even a bit easier to handle in my opinion and if you do not necessary want a certain pump also the Libre sensor should be considered.\n\nWhen it comes to the pump I made the switch after many years on MDI. I didn't want a pump for a long time for various reasons. I also managed well with MDI. I wouldn't want to live without my pump anymore, but if I had to give away my CGM it would be worse."", 'Necessary, no.

MDIs can‚Äôt provide optimal control for most people and are so much riskier/prone to mis-dosing and triggering extreme highs and lows.

However, having been using a CGM for the last four years, I can honestly say life without it sucked. I‚Äôve got so much more insight into my sugars now not the least of which is the ability to know not only if my blood sugar is 100 but in my head it up or down and what has the trend been. The trending in and of itself was huge for me because it eliminated overnight lows that once or twice resulted in an ambulance.\n\nBottom line, I‚Äôd strongly recommend you get him to TRY a Libre 3 if he has a smartphone (probably not at his age). If not Libre 3, try Libre 2 with a reader. Those are the two smallest and least intrusive devices.

The trending will be invaluable.', 'Maybe look into the G7. recently they have been getting better and are much smaller. Imo when anyone is first diagnosed they should be pushing for a CGM. Allows for much more control.', ""Yes, you can manage diabetes without a cgm and pump, but there are NO advantages to doing so. A cgm gives you so much information you can NEVER get, even using finger sticks 12+ times a day. You can see patterns and trends, tell if the blood sugar is moving up or down, and get alerts to notify you before problems happen. As a parent you can also use the follow app (your child needs a phone - it's worth it though) to be able to get alerts while you sleep, when at work, or just peek in to see how your kid is doing. A cgm will help your child be the healthiest possible, letting you see what specific meals do to his sugars. It will also give you peace of mind, letting you get a full night's sleep (my mom raised 2 of us T1s before cgms existed and was up most nights checking blood sugars), giving your son freedom to sleep over at a friend's or play at the park without you needing to hover. A cgm is 100% worth any hassle, and even if it bothers your son at first, he will get used to it. Finger sticks are painful, cause damage to the fingertips (eventually reducing sensation), and provide minimal information. There is ZERO advantage to doing this 'manually'. Occasionally, doing a finger stick to check the accuracy of the cgm or when something feels 'off' is one thing - using this method by choice is not advisable. There are a handful of people that don't get accurate results from a cgm, but even for them it is typically advantageous to use one (this is typically related to medications they take, being chronically dehydrated, or having zero body fat, and is a very small percentage of people). \n\nMy little brother was diagnosed at 3, about a decade before the first cgm even existed. Yes, we managed OK on finger sticks and mdi (he got his first pump at 7), but it meant that when he asked for seconds of dinner or a cookie in the afternoon my mom would have to remind him it would mean an extra injection. We drew 1/2 units, skinny units, and fat units (lining the edge of the plunger up with the edge of the line marking units), all on syringes with 1 unit markings (1/2 unit marked syringes were not available) to try to control his sugars. For a little person, a 1/2 unit is huge!! A pump gives the wearer so much freedom. You can eat what you want when you want without injections. This is huge for a growing child whose appetite can vary greatly from one day to the next. You can also do extended bolusing for pizza, ice cream, and other challenging foods - making them much easier. A pump means a much more normal life with a lot fewer nos. More than that, though, it means better control. With proper setup, you can have a profile for field day, sick days, sunny days (my mom could always tell what the weather was from my brother's blood sugars - the sun shining made such a difference even without activity changes), soccer games, etc. This makes control much easier. You can also set basal rates to deal with dawn phenomenon and other hormonal issues. There are so many things that go into T1 management, but the pump (especially if you get a hybrid loop) simplifies so much. \n\nI understand the idea that you want your son to learn to do things manually. What if the tech fails, etc. To this, I would say that learning now how to manage manually isn't really helpful for a future issue. I spent over 20 years on mdi and finger sticks. I am still lost without the data from my cgm. I dose more on trend arrows than I do on current sugar, and I can't get this info using finger sticks. Yes, I can keep myself alive (sort of, I am hypoglycemic, unaware, so the alarms on dexcom are literally a life saver), but old experience wasn't an advantage for this at all. I have also had a couple of pump failures in the last 10 years. Both times, I had to go on mdi for 1-3 days to get a replacement pump. In theory, I knew how to convert my basal to long-acting insulin and switch to bolus for short acting, but it's not like you just pick up your old insulin dosing and go on fine. Control is much more fine-tuned with a pump, and mdi can never easily replace it. It's a new learning curve every switch. If even 20 years of mdi doesn't prepare you for a tech failure, what difference does learning to do it manually before switching make?\n\n\nThe areas I do think it is important to at least understand how to do things manually are in calculating insulin dose (my blood sugar is 200 and my target is 100, I have a correction factor of 1:35, how much insulin do I need or I want to eat 52 carbs and my carb ratio is 1:10, how much insulin do I need). These are the skills it will take your son time to learn, and some can never manage complex numbers (my carb ratio is 1:17 or 1:18 depending on time of day. I have a math minor, but even I used simpler numbers when doing things manually and calculated 1:15 or 1:20 - mental math gets complicated and prone to error). Teaching your son to estimate his insulin dose and comparing it to the calculated pump dose will both teach him how to do the math and serve as a double check - you are less likely to give 20 units of insulin instead of entering 20 grams of carb (just over 1 unit in my case), if you always compare the amount being delivered with the amount you expect. The math is the only manual skill I personally believe has an advantage in today's world. If tech fails, your doctor can tell you how to deal with it (most insurance companies have 24-hour advice with a doctor on call), but if you don't understand the math it can be a real challenge. The advantage of using a pump sooner is that it can help keep your child safe from errors in the math while they are learning, and minimizes the risks of accidentally overdosing (its still possible, but the cgm will alert you and you have a history on the pump so you can figure out exactly what happened). \n\nTo mention one other thing, you said the nurse is on board with manually doing blood sugars and injections at school. Have you talked about what happens when she is sick? It's easy to have teachers, the principal, or other adults at the school help ensure that the blood sugar and carb amount are correct and deliver insulin on a pump (and many children can start doing this on their own with supervision pretty young - pumps also can have lock functions to prevent the kid from deciding to dose on their own), but it is much more challenging to find someone willing and able to give an injection (and this requires certification in many states). Are you planning on trying to use an insulin like NPH to avoid injections at school? Or are you going to the school every day to give your son insulin for lunch?"", ""I'm a huge pump proponent.  I've been on one for 15 years(T1 for 37) and I have no intentions to ever go back to MDI.  But I also say that it's up to the individual to make their own mind up, because they are the one that has to wear it 24/7.  As far as the CGM goes, and I don't have sensory issues, but usually after it's on, you usually forget it's there.\n\nSo, while I'd never willingly give up my pump and/or CGM, I'll say that it's not 100% necessary to have one or either.  Neither of these things existed, at least in the practical mainstream sense that they do today, back when I was diagnosed.  And I, and millions of others made it through.  I went \\~22 years doing MDI.  And then an additional seven before I got a CGM(would have been sooner, but it took forever before the Animas Vibe, which was the first pump with integrated CGM/Dexcom display capability was approved by the FDA here in the US)."", 'Look the research is clear, the technology is better for t1ds.

Pump isn‚Äôt entirely necessary, but I‚Äôd encourage it if you don‚Äôt want to have to deal with injections at every meal.', 'He needs and deserves a CGM. It can and probably will save his life at some point. I would say the same about the pump but to a lesser extent.', 'My daughter is t1 and autistic with severe sensory issues. She hated dexcom at first and took a year break. Went back to dexcom and now uses libre 3. She has far less issue with it. She also uses omnipod and likes it more than MDI but she was very resistant to it for a long time.', ""I spent the first 11 years of my diabetes old school with just finger pricks and shots. So it is not necessary. But I will say that after I switched to a CGM and pump, my A1c's went from the 8's to the 6's. my health today is so, so much better.\n\nI think the pump is  debatable - it definitely has its pros and cons - but I would recommend **every** diabetic get a CGM. You can pry my CGM out of my cold, dead, hands. It gives me so much more peace of mind and security, and so much better information. Without it I feel like I'm fumbling around in the dark. I would highly, highly recommend it. I really can't overstate that.\n\nOn the pump: overall I'm glad I have it and plan to stick with it. The new pumps and integrate with the CGMs, like Tandem's Control IQ is so amazing. It is really the cutting edge. I finally feel like I have someone else helping me manage my diabetes, and its not all on me.  It is really the next step forward in diabetes care. \n\nHaving a pump also makes managing my diabetes easier in my day to day life. In the old days I'd have to leave class to go to the bathroom to give myself shots. And you can only do that so many times. I ended up missing out on a lot of things in my life, and delaying giving a lot of needed shots, because of this. With the pump, the other day I was running late to a work meeting, and as I hurried to get there when I got into the elevator, I looked at my CGM, saw I was high, and gave myself insulin - all from my phone which talks to my pump! It took five seconds. In the old days I'd have to either (1) be late to my meeting and risk impacting my career, or (2) run high for hours until I could find time for a shot. This happens many times a day, and blousing from the pump is just so much more convenient. \n\nOn the downside with the pump thought, I have a lot of anxiety about pump site failure. I have had several instances where I inserted the pump site wrong and I figure it out after several hours of being high and feeling sick and have to change the site. Once it happened and I was so freaked out about ketones I went to the ER to get help. I probably didn't need to go, but I was throwing up at that point. So there are definitely pros and cons with the pump. It is not a perfect technology, and there is a learning curve and there is work required on my part to utilize it correctly. But all in all I think my life is better with the pump.\n\nBut CGM's, no question. Everyone should get one. \n\nGood luck!\n\nhttps://www.tandemdiabetes.com/providers/products/control-iq"", 'Personally, as someone who‚Äôs T1 and also has sensory issues the Omnipod I got when I was diagnosed was a lifesaver.

Most people soak the adhesive with unisolv and it comes right off like a bandaid. \n\nBut do what‚Äôs best for you. Maybe an education session where your little guy can play around with the devices and touch them. But if he is still okay with MDI, then let it be. If he is interested in devices, take his lead and explore.', 'Yes, I‚Äôve managed without the tech for many years and my a1c is in the 6-7 range, the best it‚Äôs ever been. I have skin allergies and get very irritated by adhesives but if I could use a CGM i absolutely would. In fact, my endo just ordered me the dexcom G7 to try because it‚Äôs supposed to be a bit easier on the skin and I‚Äôm very excited to give it another go! Managing without a CGM is doable but it is hard and I am an adult with t1d for 20 years. For someone his age I think, If he can get used to wearing one, it will make life so much easier for him and everyone else involved in his management. It‚Äôs definitely worth a try!', 'Yes I managed for over 25 years without a CGM. Would I want to do it again ‚Äî hell no. CGM is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Pump is great too but CGM ftw', 'My only suggestion would be considering it again before your son goes through puberty. As a teenager who used both MDI and a pump going through puberty, I will say that having the ability to change basal insulin for different times of day and constantly changing it due to hormones that come with the territory is really useful.\n\nBut for now, don‚Äôt force him to do anything he doesn‚Äôt want to do.', 'cgm is soooo helpful especially to understand what spikes and dips your son‚Äôs BG levels. it overall reduces testing times to calibrations only and gives you a lot more data. pump is less critical now as you are the full time manager of your son‚Äôs insulin injections, but as he gets older its a convenience that he might want to opt into. your a1c and point testing only gives you so much information on your true control of diabetes. as someone who is diagnosed early, it is so critical for your son to harness good habits and control asap to avoid complications in the future. it is unfair, but the more exposure the body has to the stresses of diabetes makes it more vulnerable in the future- its a long long marathon. reduce as many of your sons future obstacles as you can right now, especially if you are in a situation where its accessible and affordable. \n\nmdi and no cgm might produce good results for adults with fully developed frontal lobes and self awareness of low/high symptoms, but kiddos entering school and wanting to eat/do everything their friends are doing + educators that may or may not be watching for red flag symptoms may need a little more interference health wise- just my opinion as a former kid', ""So, I've been diabetic since I was 10 and I didn't get a pump or CGM until it was about 35. It absolutely does make a difference in being able to control your diabetes. I'm not even sure if it was available to me when I was first diagnosed, but once my endos have been asking me about it I was hesitant to it because I didn't want to give the robots an easy way to kill me once Skynet goes live. Anyways Jokes Aside, it really does give you a lot more control than not being on the pump or CGM. Plus as a parent it can help you more easily know when your kid is having a low. Lows can be deadly, especially if it's a late night low. In the past I think they would rather a kid stay slightly high than to risk a low, but that's at the disadvantage of causing health problems later on in life. With a pump, you may be able to have tighter control to reduce some of the complications later on. Especially with a kid. Also, when they go into their teenage years it's going to be even harder to manage their blood sugar. A pump will give you an easier way of control. You can address your basal insulin throughout the day, you can have different boluses based off of the type of food that you eat and the time of day that you're eating, a pump can also address how much insulin it's giving you based off of how much insulin you already have in your system. I would really recommend it if you could."", ""The pump absolutely isn't necessary. It probably would make life easier for them though. I doubt they're comfortable giving themselves shots at 5 y/o. I got diagnosed at 12, and didn't get a CGM until I was 30. I almost never tested ages 20-30. Totally possible to live like that. Don't do it though. Give your kid everytl tool they can to manage their diabetes. Poor control, especially at a young age can be really rough on them when they're older. My older brother who is also T1D since he was 4, and didn't get a CGM until he was 34 has had some long term complications that could have been avoided if he had a CGM earlier. I totally get wanting them to be able to manage without tech, but that's a long long process, and can be devastating to their health in the long run. I'd personally heavily encourage a CGM as soon as possible. And a pump if/when they want one."", 'I am a T1.  I also used to be a preschool teacher.  I had a child in my care who was 5.  He was a T1d and a lot of his care ended up being transferred to me because I understood it.  This was a while back and he was MDI and finger pokes.  \n\nSometimes at outdoor time I would notice him getting pale and sweaty and would call him over. We would sit on the stairs and I would ask how he was feeling.  He was usually ""fine"". I would point out what I saw and suggest we do a poke.  He was usually low.  I was trying to teach him and model to him to mind the signs.  The other teachers started asking what I was doing...because they too thought he was fine.  They didn\'t get it, they didn\'t live it.  They did start noticing some of the same signs I did.  But you really cannot rely on a 5-year-old to notice all the time as he is dropping. Nor can you count on the staff to notice the subtle changes and catch it while it\'s not an emergency.  \n\nCGM can be a powerful tool, I would not discount it.', ""Would recommend a Libre if he has sensory issues. I use a Libre and can't feel it at all, to the extent that when I need to scan it with my phone, I have to feel around to find it."", 'If you can afford a CGM you should absolutely get one. Full stop.', ""Of course they aren't absolutely necessary. I am still on MDI but I do use a CGM. But in the late 80's and 90's there wasn't any CGM. I went to school with injections and a regular glucometor."", 'I did without CGM, pump or pens with insulin developments over thirty years. So absolutely necessary?  No. \n\nTo this day nearly forty years later I‚Äôve refused pumps, but for me, CGM enforced really good habits, but I wouldn‚Äôt subject a five year old nor ten year old to it. \n\nTo keep much of my same anonymity what I‚Äôve done is put phone on silent, and shut alarms off. I‚Äôve got an Apple Watch that always displays my reading, and how much it changed in five minutes. I also use a program used endobits to give me a thirty minute warning things are awry‚Ä¶ I need a bit of food, exercise, or a few units of insulin. When that rumbles my wrist, time to act. It‚Äôs all really good, but at the same time anxiety causing when rumbles are non-stop and you have something else to try and focus on. I needed six months to really adjust to those warnings and changing my habits. It‚Äôs a bigger life alteration than injections and testing for me.  At some point, maybe 15 or so, likely a good time to have such a system to enforce proper habits‚Ä¶. It gets real slippy when you don‚Äôt test, don‚Äôt make time to handle things and worry more about hanging out/drinking with friends. Until then?  Have fast acting sugar always. Keep a pen in a Frio.

Don't get me wrong I'm aware it's there and it can get itchy but the patch matters to me. You can get different types of patches so no issues. The adhesive sticker is a plaster like material.\n\nI would suggest a cgm especially with school as we all know when kids get engrossed with their friends they ignore their basic needs at times so an alarm would help massively with lows especially if he hasn't fully learnt to feel them and you can't always feel them.\n\nAs for manually managing it you absolutely can but I regularly babysit a 5y/o boy who does understand my diabetes but I would air on the side of caution in teaching a child of that age manual management with a glucose meter with the view to him doing it himself. \n\nAlso a cgm doesn't take away the need for finger pricking at all so he will still learn without the risk to him of ignoring low symptoms coz he's having fun at school.\n\nAnd you can see his sugars at home even when he's at school to ease your own anxiety. \n\nEdit: spelling"", 'I would think getting him a CGM  for your benefit and his safety would be the way to go. While the idea of having him learn all the complexities of doing everything manually, he‚Äôs not going to be old enough to manage his own diabetes until his teens or later. At that point, puberty and all the physical changes of becoming a teen are going to make his blood sugars really unpredictable, so the CGM is a really good tool for seeing what works best. Sensory wise, putting it on the back of his arm or butt might work best- I truly find I do not notice my dexcom if I can‚Äôt really see it. Obviously both pump and CGM are optional but the fact is that the CGM is a game changer and is nice because 1 poke replaces the 8+ finger sticks every day. And also it can alert you that he might be going low before he potentially has a low at school and not with the school nurse. But also trying out a CGM doesn‚Äôt mean you suddenly HAVE to keep using it, you could try it for a couple of months and if it doesn‚Äôt work switch back. \n\nYou are doing a great job, he is so lucky to have you as a parent.', 'CGMs are incredible. The improvement they provide to time in range is crazy compared to manually reading blood glucose a couple times a day.', 'As a teacher, I would definitely recommend you have your child get at least a CGM/Dexcom. It really was helpful for me to know when I should call the nurse, when T1 student needed or could have snack, or whether or not they needed a juice then and there because they were low. It also gave me insight on what their numbers or range typically should be. \n\nSchool nurses also are absent and will not have subs like teachers do. Teachers also have 20+ other students and some with extreme behaviors. Teachers have to make over a thousand decisions a day and so much happens within the school day. It is easy to forget about one student when another student is having a breakdown or needs help problem solving. \n\nI say this with the best intention, please get some form of monitor on your child for their benefit. Schools/staff are not equipped to handle a lot of things. T1 diabetes is one of them.', 'I‚Äôm just saying as a diabetic - I‚Äôd be so disappointed in my mum not letting me try out a cgm and pump. He might be scared, but that‚Äôs normal for a 5yo. He wouldn‚Äôt be scared if you‚Äôd be more positive towards cgm and pump. You should want to give him the most independence he can get.

No disrespect meant, but do you have T1D? Who suggested to you that this was necessary or a good strategy?\n\nYour son will learn so much more about his diabetes from using a CGM than he will ever learn from finger sticks and the pump is the same because you try to mimic a working pancreas so much more closely with it than with injections.  Obviously, you don\'t do this at first and you can run a pump in a less ""intensive"" way until he\'s ready for more but, aside from learning to inject, which takes no time, there\'s nothing more that he\'ll learn from taking the manual route.\n\nEdit: I have had T1D for 32v years and managed it with inductions for the first 12-13 years. While I\'ve used CGM for short periods over the past 4-5 years, I\'ve only been using it consistently for the past 13 months.', 'Honestly, I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôd want to send your 5 year old to school where you aren‚Äôt going to be with him all day without a CGM. Different activities during recess or PE are likely to affect his blood sugar in ways you can‚Äôt predict, and this is a way for you to monitor his blood sugar all the time at home. Also teachers and aids aren‚Äôt necessarily going to notice if he‚Äôs low before it‚Äôs too late, and that‚Äôs the reality. Sure you don‚Äôt have to have a CGM or pump, but as someone who has had T1D for 30 years and an insulin pump for 26 years and CGM for 16 years, you couldn‚Äôt pay me to live without either a pump or CGM. I have two kids (4 & 5) and if they were diagnosed today, I‚Äôd immediately start them on CGMs and insulin pumps.', 'All of us T1s that have been T1s for many years can tell you, yes, you can survive without a pump and CGM.

They also make fun over patches. Let your son pick a pack he likes and make putting on dexcom a fun expression of his personality. Don't let him see your anxiety and just talk about the positives. Show him the graphs and tell him this is what is going on inside his body, let him eat a food that you find challenging and usually avoid so you can both see what happens. Try to make it a fun adventure so that he doesn't focus on the sensation. Remind him that he doesn't need to take as many finger sticks when wearing this (especially if he complains about them normally) if he is irritated by the dexcom. If you can get him to last a full session (10 days), you will probably be fine. If your son tends to have any allergies to bandaids, lotions, etc, use Flonase before the first application (you don't want an allergic reaction to make this process more challenging). Your doctor may be able to give you the first sensor for free, especially if you are looking at the dexcom g7 since it is 100% disposable. Even if not, as long as you have good insurance, you shouldn't be out much if your son really can't handle it, but I think you will be surprised. Dexcom is typically pretty painless, though the insertion sound is a bit starting on the on the g6 (I haven't tried the g7 yet). You might be best off trying the back of the hip first, where your son won't see it as much - though if he really likes the stickers and wants to show it off the arm can be good. You could also try to find a kid friendly robot movie and tell him he can be a cyborg (robot technology integrated into human flesh).

And, almost as importantly, checking BG levels from the classroom on a phone/receiver is far less disruptive to his learning routine than going to the nurse for finger sticks before snack, before and after recess, before lunch, after PE, etc. Our now 9 year old T1D absolutely despises the occasional days when he has Dexcom issues and must go back to the ‚Äúold‚Äù way of finger sticks at the nurse.\n\nThe pump is less critical at your son‚Äôs age if his school has a nurse who is willing to deliver insulin via pen/syringe, but eventually a pump will allow your son significantly more freedom at school.

I have heard that other places it‚Äôs a bit harder to find somewhere to insert it. The way it works is the sensor is in your skin and the transmitter is on your arm with a very nice adhesive that you can take off at any time. The transmitter needs to be charged like once a day(15 min max) and when it is off you get no readings to your phone. The system requires calibrations, 2 daily to start and then once a day after about a month, but it‚Äôs pretty picky so it will switch back to twice a day a lot.

"T2 ""turning into"" T1-can anyone help me to explain to others with data resources they are different diseases even if there are commonalities in symptoms?","There is a prevalence of this being parroted on reddit and am at a loss to explain anymore. Loss of beta cells in T2 does not mean they are a T1 (they can be functionally treated in a similar fashion, but the causes of both differ) so why would you now state a t2 is called a t1 and medically classified as such? **This is not a debate about T1 vs T2 but about why people will state a T2 will ""turn into"" a T1.** I have run into explaining this a few times just in the last few days. There seems to be a lack of understanding that two different diseases and disease states can have similar treatments, but hey are not the same disease. I would never say a patient with a melanoma now has liver cancer because they both require chemotherapy.

I have had discussions with a doctor who stated it's ""easier to explain to patients"" by telling a T2 they are now T1 because they prescribed insulin. I'm at a loss-there is enough misunderstanding about types, disease pathways, causes and treatments.  Constant misunderstandings affect all types and how we are treated in medical situations. Your thoughts?

Edit-further to this in T1 there are other issues other than exogenous insulin. We‚Äôre looking at amylin, possible dysfunction of the alpha cells and feedback system, and other issues. Just because someone is needing therapy involving exogenous insulin does not mean they are functionally a T1 and types do not convert nor turn into different types-commonalities exists but if I developed insulin resistance as a T1 I wouldn‚Äôt be coded as a T2 in my chart either. It‚Äôs hard to explain to people even though it‚Äôs a very simple definition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14oqmj1/t2_turning_into_t1can_anyone_help_me_to_explain/,"[""I always bring up the fact that t1 is an autoimmune disease and t2 is (most commonly) a metabolic disease.

It usually doesn‚Äôt take long at all.', 'This misunderstanding could also come from the fact that so many LADA diabetics get diagnosed as t2 and treated accordingly until their last remaining beta cells are killed off and they are fully dependent on insulin.  If their doctors fail to explain that they were misdiagnosed, it could appear that you are a t1 that was a short time ago a t2.', 'Am an educator (and have t1) and I have worked with many T2 patients who take basal/bolus insulin and many who are on insulin pumps. They have definitely not been turned into T1 diabetics. The main difference I see in these situations is that they use a massively larger amount of insulin than T1 patients because insulin resistance is a key feature of T2 diabetes. People with T2 often will still have a positive C-peptide and often even a higher than normal result. They are often still making insulin it‚Äôs just not enough to meet their needs because of insulin resistance. I have T2 patients who sometimes take concentrated insulins off label in their pumps. \n\n\nI had a T2 new to Omnipod 5 recently, pod only lasts 1.5 days, ICR 1:2. Patient has to take other drugs like Ozempic just to control blood sugars, even with >100 units of insulin a day. Insulin resistance is still in play with T2 diabetes. Yes, people with t1 diabetes can also have insulin resistance but usually not to the extent I see with T2. It still happens, it is just far less common. The diseases have completely different causes that can be seen throughout the course of someone‚Äôs life with diabetes.', 'I would solidly place the blame on the doctors here - I have heard this a lot from T2‚Äôs who take insulin and now proclaim they have T1 (the majority of which are only on a low dose of basal) but if they ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù it will ‚Äúgo back to T2‚Äù.  It‚Äôs just bad education all around and it compounds the misunderstandings that already exist regarding T1. \n\nI lost a huge amount of weight 2 1/2 years ago and the number of people I know who were aware that I had T1 before, all were seemingly shocked that I both still have diabetes and still require insulin is astonishing. They all somehow assumed the weight loss would be some kind of magical cure and that‚Äôs just not how it works at all. It‚Äôs frustrating but people just don‚Äôt know and the sheer amount of BS given to people by doctors regarding diabetes doesn‚Äôt help.', 'I still wish that there were different terms for the types of diabetes.

Type 1 is an autoimmune disease where our pancreas does not produce enough insulin, glucagon, amylin etc. That has a swathe of effects such as having no defense mechanism for going low blood sugar, so low blood sugar kills us.\n\nI\'m very sorry about what you went through but that in no way makes type 2 diabetes and type 1 the same thing. It doesn\'t need to be the Olympics here.', 'There is two different disease, one is where the body BARELY make any insulin, and other one where it makes plenty, an amount that would be otherwise enough to keep a healthy person bloodsugar in check, but for multiple reasons, it cant.\n\nNo point of blend these two different diseases together.

For example, Œ≤-cell mass is also reduced in people with type 2 diabetes (67). In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the stress response induced by hyperglycemia may play a role in Œ≤-cell apoptosis (68). Changes in Œ≤-cell phenotype associated with hyperglycemia may reflect a dedifferentiation of Œ≤-cells important to the natural history and staging of diabetes (69). Clearly, an insufficient number or functional decline of Œ≤-cells is central to hyperglycemia and the downstream complications of diabetes.

coming back from a severe weigh loss due to dibetic ketoacidosis,"Context:

I was diagnosed in May 2020 at the age of 18. During my debut, I experienced diabetic ketoacidosis, which lasted for approximately 3 weeks. 

I'm sure everyone in this sub already knows this but I will explain it just in case: during a diabetic ketoacidosis the body degrades fat and muscle to generate energy resulting in an extremely fast and unhealthy weight loss.

In the 3 weeks that my ketoacidosis lasted I lost 22 lbs (10 kg). The first photo is from the day I was discharged from the hospital. For reference, I am 178 cm (5'10"") tall and weighed 59 kg (130 lbs).

In the second photo, I gained 24 lbs (11 kg) after 3 years of going to the gym. I weighed 70 kg (154 lbs). I didn't consistently go to the gym during those 3 years because, due to the extreme muscle loss, my shoulder stabilizer muscles were too weak. When I returned to the gym, I instantly injured myself, and I had to slowly regain my muscle mass. I dedicated almost an entire year to rehabilitation exercises to restore the health of my shoulders enough to be able to do bench presses or pull-ups again. 
In summary, that's it. I just wanted to share my progress and know if anyone had a similar experience :)",https://i.redd.it/cqpyfyc9ue9b1.png,"[""Bro congrats.

Freestyle Libre 2 very sensitive?,"Question for the Freestyle peeps! I've recently been diagnosed T1D (31M) and I'm trialling the FL2 before my doctor adds it to my prescription and I'm noticing that my readings tend to vary wildly.

Is this normal behaviour with the FL2? I know it's not overly accurate, but getting a low/high alarm is quite distressing and can be frustrating when testing shows that it's not actually the case.

Even 60 units doesn't sound like a lot for teenage boy, 60 units at 1:1 would be for 60 kg which is 132 pounds. \n\n\\- you using Omnipod or Medtronic? Novolog or Humalog? It's possible your body is developing a resistance to Humalog or Novolog, it happens and switching over to the other insulin could help. If you are using ultra fast, a lot of loopers have reported that FIASP and Lyumyev eventually stop working consistently (that's in the minority but it's pretty well documented on the FB Looped and Loop and learn groups). We had an issue with Humalog being inconsistent and the issues went away after switching to Novolog.\n\n\\- if you are using Pods, there can be issues with day 1 and day 3 pods. We had no issues with Novolog but with both Humalog and Fiasp, we need to change the pods early and give some phantom carbs on the pod change.\n\nHow are you calculating TDI? Nightscout / AppleHealth or Tidepool? Nightscout's calculations can be a little off, I find Tidepool the easiest to read.  \n\n\nAny other patterns as to when the insulin needs seem to be higher? I'd track time of day, what day of the infusion set I was on, how long was my pre-bolus. One issue with TDI and loop is depending on your settings, your bolus can be late, you get stuck on a high and the Loop algo doesn't account for people having a higher insulin resistance at higher blood sugar numbers. AAPS does have a feature to handle that.\n\nDo you use the custom type one patches for loop?

Another frustration in the life of T1D (rant/vent),"I went to Kings Island today with a couple of friends and bought their famous blue ice cream. Now I usually don't eat full sugar ice cream but I considered it a treat because I was with my friends and didn't want to be left out and let's face it, a girl just wants ice cream sometimes. ü•∫ Anyway as y'all know one-off shops like that aren't required to post nutritional information online. I bolused for 45g but feel like I underbolused... but also was afraid of going low if I'd overbolused. My friends were appalled that I couldn't find accurate nutrition info (I mean I am too but I'm used to it by this point) so they asked first the ice cream shop workers who tried to find out but didn't know (theyre hourly workers so I don't blame them) and then guest services. Guest services also didn't know (again, not surprisingly) but they tried calling the company that supplies the ice cream to find out. After another 15 minutes, they came back with this number (see pic). The guest services lady was so kind and so proud of herself for finding the ""sugar amount"" that I didn't have the heart to tell her how wrong the information is. Pardon my French but WHAT THE HELL? FIVE grams of sugar in one serving of full sugar, LARGE amusement park ice cream? My friends who know little about average carb amounts and T1D were pleased with the info, thanked the lady, and we left, but this experience is evidence of ongoing struggles with this disease. Really taught me not to trust what uninformed people say about sugar/carbs, as well-meaning as they are. Trust your gut if you think nutrition information given to you is way too high or too low. It sucks but ultimately when you are the one that has to deal with the disease, you will understand the disease way better than anyone else. In retrospect, maybe I should have told the guest services lady how wrong the info she gave me was, because we really was going out of her way to try out.

Is it better to have a few lows and a few highs or no lows and a few more highs?,"The past few weeks I‚Äôve been trying to minimize lows. My normal time in range is like 90% in range, 5% high, and 5% low. The highs typically peak at around 220 and the lows would go to 65 or slightly under. Though my time in range and highs were great, I read that most endocrinologists don‚Äôt recommend being in the low more than 4% of the time, and I‚Äôve also read so pretty scary studies about the correlation between lows and brain issues later in life (dementia). 

Because of this, I‚Äôve been doing everything in my power to prevent lows. As a result I‚Äôve had 0 lows in the last 14 days but my highs are now around 8% or so.

Summer and lows,"A bit of a rant. 
I used to love summers, but since diagnosed i am struggling with the heat and lows. 
I usually feel that im low when i get hot - but since its summer and we have a heatwave - i feel hot all the time, which leads to me not noticing a low and letting it go untreated to the point of almost fainting (for example - today i realised i should check my sugar was at a point that i felt drunk and my sugar was already 1,3mmol/l). I hate that diabetes is making me hate summer‚Ä¶ i used to love it. 

P.S. - before anyone recomends getting sensors and pump - none of that is covered in my country and the expenses to cover them pretty much are the same as renting another apartment. So while i tehnically can afford it, i cant justify doing that to my family - since i wouldnt be able to participate in paying rent, groceries, etc. Bleep diabetes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14o74mj/summer_and_lows/,"['I always reduce my basal for the summer.

Dexcom G7 - I Genuinely Like It,"I‚Äôve not seen even one positive post about the G7 since its launch, so I was dubious about trying it. After holding my endo hostage in the office for 30 minutes to unleash a barrage of questions about it, my endo gave me two sensors to try, and I truly liked it, so I changed my prescription. 

I used the G6 for 5 years (after 13 years of finger sticks and a horrible year with Medtronic‚Äôs early CGM beast) before trying the G7, and I can earnestly say that I like the G7 more.

You cannot expect to apply the same ratios and the same schedules every time. I personally am quite rigorous but you also need flexibility for different needs.

Helps prevent hypos during sleep. \n\n- exercise. Physical activity increases your BG control overall (but you have to be careful not to go too low, talk to your endo and dietist, everyone has different personal needs). Even a 10 min walk after eating helps quite a lot in avoiding spikes. \n\n- reduce the stressors in your life. Stress will increase your BG levels, other illnesses may influence your glucose production and management too. Being sick makes your BG go zig zag. \n\nI personally eat between 8.00 and 9.00 for breakfast, 12.45 and 13.45 at lunch and 20.15 to 21 in the evening.

Allergic to aspartame & sucralose,"This might be a stupid dumb moronic question and I am mainly just looking for validation that‚Äôs it is a stupid dumb moronic question, so you‚Äôll have to excuse my 3 months post diagnosis na√Øvet√© but‚Ä¶..

I‚Äôm allergic to aspartame and Sucralose. I am not complaining too much, not a good vibe about either and I did well avoiding them for the first 30 years of my life prior to my T1D diagnosis. However, during those ‚Äúglory days‚Äù I guess I now think of them as, I did enjoy the occasional soda with lunch. Certainly not every day and most of the time just a couple of times a month. But now, I can‚Äôt have the diabetic safe options either. I have a wild reaction to pure sugar or juice so barring serious advancements in stem cell pancreases, I completely understand I will never have a whole coke or dr. pepper ever again in my life, even with all the insulin on the planet, but my dumb question is: if I safely budget for it maybe down the line when I‚Äôm more experienced with insulin dosing etc, could I have a sip? Even maybe 1-2oz over ice slowly, knowing it would certainly cause a jump if not a total spike? 

I should note, I‚Äôm positive that this has become an all consuming thought simply because I can‚Äôt or certainly should not have any regular soda period, and under my previous circumstances, the prospect of my next Coca Cola wouldn‚Äôt even be a vapor of an idea. 

And I don‚Äôt want anyone to think I‚Äôm the type of person who would simply have a coke and say screw the consequences. I am very type A. I am currently sitting at 99% in my slightly generous dexcom range of 70-180, 3 months into my diagnosis, which I think is fairly good, and dropped my A1C from 15 to 6.9 in 60 days which I know was quite fast but it was a huge instant lifestyle shift. I‚Äôm not playing games with my health. But I just can‚Äôt shake the idea of a nice refreshing soft drink right now.

So olipop is marketing itself as a lower carb option due to the fibre, but that isn‚Äôt likely to work for a t1. \n\nLooking for drinks that are 0 calorie/0 carb are the safest for us. Zevia is one of those. Some diabetics may get a rise in sugars due to caffine, but this is way less likely in Diet Coke compared with coffee. \n\nAll in all trial and error. IMO don‚Äôt get caught up in that net carb bs. A lot of us also have to bolus for protein and fat (not just carbs) so that might also be raising sugars.']"

Figured I‚Äôd share this incase it helps. Regarding cost Information for those who use tslim x2.,"I‚Äôm sure there is plenty of people who know this but in the case some people don‚Äôt, my current supplier for my infusion sets and cartridges for my tslim x2 insulin pump is better living now in which even with 40% coinsurance they want me to pay $150 which isn‚Äôt awful but I then contacted tandem themselves to see what a direct out of pocket cost for them would be and it actually came out to be $135 which saves me $15 a month directly through them rather than my DME supplier and I personally prefer talking to tandem over any of these terrible DME companies, I hope this helps anyone struggling with costs. Wishing everyone the best!

EDIT: also for anyone getting charged ridiculous amounts for their dexcom sensors, try to see if you can move it to your pharmacy prescriptions which for me atleast moved mine into a tier list which is way cheaper than my coinsurance cost, make sure that the pharmacy you call is able to supply it monthly and then you will just have to have your PCP put it in your prescription list.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14nx6sr/figured_id_share_this_incase_it_helps_regarding/,"['Fortunately Tandem is in network with my insurance and I get my supplies from them directly for a flat co-pay.  Both Dexcom and my insurance originally told me I‚Äôd have to use Byram for Dexcom, and Byram said I‚Äôd have to me my $2,000 deductible and then pay 30% co-insurance after that.  Insurance said it would be the same flat co-pay but Byram said they don‚Äôt bill that way.  I then called insurance and their mail order pharmacy and found I can get it that way, so much cheaper and I don‚Äôt have to worry about the deductible and co-insurance.', 'What‚Äôs odd to me is that my dexcom has to come from a ‚Äúspecial pharmacy‚Äù like 60 miles away.

Why do I need a pharmacy at all, especially when most pharmacies can‚Äôt even supply it.', 'So glad to hear! Honestly it‚Äôs really sad how these companies take advantage of our need for these supplies and even my insurance was saying how a DME would be the cheapest and come to find out using tandem without them taking my insurance is still considerably cheaper than my DME which is honestly dumbfounding but exactly why even though you can trust your insurance to an extent you should never follow their advice to the T which is an unfortunate reality.', 'What kinda pharmacy if I may ask? Most insurances if not all have restrictions on what companies can fulfill your supplies otherwise you could pay them out of pocket from dexcom but you‚Äôd have to check the price from when your insurance covers it to when they don‚Äôt and see if it‚Äôd be worth ( assuming you currently use a DME supplier ) have you asked your insurance if they will it cover it through dexcom directly?

How to stay motivated with lows and exercise,"I have been trying to get into fitness and going to the gym ever since my T1 diagnosis but haven‚Äôt been able to stay motivated. I‚Äôm underweight and have little to no muscle on me and want to just generally become stronger and get better stamina, but whenever in go to the gym, within 5-10 minutes of moderate exercise ( usually cardio but recently weight lifting ) my BG is 3.0 ( 53 ) going down and I have to stop for 20~ minutes before starting again. I have adjusted my basal for 2~ hours before and during the gym along with glucose tabs before and during exercise but nothing stops me from crashing. All of this has caused me to not want to go to the gym and not be motivated enough to go. Does anyone have any advice or any other ways to stop my BG from crashing so soon? My diabetes is well controlled and I‚Äôm in range 80-90% of the time other then these lows; I‚Äôm on the Dexcom G6 and Omnipod 5 if that helps or makes a difference",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14nzoqy/how_to_stay_motivated_with_lows_and_exercise/,"['I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. I‚Äôve had diabetes for 25 years and I still struggle with this and know how disheartening it can be. However, I have a few suggestions. Maybe try adjusting the basal 3 hours before (if possible) or if you regularly exercise at the same time of day, you could have a different basal setting with a much lower basal for that time of day. Also, instead of just glucose tabs before exercising, you could try a more substantial snack or meal, something with protein and carbs, and experiment with how much insulin you give yourself for that snack. I tend to get low when I do cardio as well so I usually put my pump in exercise mode at least 2 hours before hand, eat something like a protein bar and a piece of fruit, and only bolus for about half of the carbs. I also tend to have 2 glucose tabs as I get started. I still do sometimes get low, even with that but it doesn‚Äôt tend to be as severe. However, everybody is different and hopefully others have other suggestions in case these don‚Äôt work for you. I would also recommend reaching out to your doctor and seeing if they have an exercise specialist on staff. Sometimes hospitals have someone dedicated to helping diabetics figure out the best way to exercise and avoid super lows. I hope this is helpful and good luck!', 'im on the omnipod 5 and dexcom too! i put myself in ""sport mode"" (activity mode lol) an hour before going to the gym. i make sure im a little high, like 150. i get a gatorade w sugar and drink that while i workout, almost like replacing the sugar im working off haha. works pretty well for me, id rather be a little high than crash! good luck', ""So usually you want to be around 7-9 before you start exercising\n\nUsually cardio drops sugar levels and heavy weight lifting raises your sugar levels immediately after and in some cases you need a small correction dose when lifting heavy weights.\n\nOn a non diabetic note I'd say if you are trying to put on some weight then I'd avoid cardio and concentrate on eating more food and lifting weights instead. You are potentially hitting the cardio with some active insulin and that's causing you to nose dose into your 3s, I personally wouldn't work out below 5 so try taking some quick acting sugar before and see how that affects it and aim to be at the higher end of your range.\n\nRemember your body will be more sensitive to insulin after working out and it's common to have low sugar levels between 6-8 hours after working out !\n\nI work out 5-6 days a week and been diabetic for the majority of my life so feel free to DM if you have more questions"", 'I would always have a small snack 15-30 minutes before.

The autoimmune response casing the T1D hasn‚Äôt stopped- it‚Äôs still ongoing, killing off more and more of the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Assuming the overall diabetes onset (not the re-diagnosis) is recent, you probably have a significant amount of those cells providing extra natural insulin.

If you think that‚Äôs a possibility stop using that pharmacy. Have the script transferred or tell your doc to send a new one. I prefer to use a mail order pharmacy because sometimes the reason that pharmacy‚Äôs are slowing getting your script filled is the sheer volume of transactions they encounter.

Dramatic 30x increase in ISF/CF caused very severe lows - ideas?,"(Crossposting from /r/type1diabetes)

My 6 yo kiddo‚Äôs CF was 100 with MDI, that was changed to 120 when we put him on the op5 last week.

First day or two with the pump was fine but at some point it seems like his CF has increased about 25-30x.

2-3 days back he had a severe stubborn crash from 250 to 45 even though we started treating him at 90 when he was going down. He did turn around but it took a lot of carbs. The dose we had given him was only 0.2 units‚Ä¶

After we recovered, we saw that 0.05 units was causing a drop of 100-150 points. Very erratic reaction to insulin dosing, but spike after carbs was typical.

Yesterday, he needed more insulin and seemed that his CF was a little lower. Today, few hours back though, CF has dropped back to near normal levels. Now 1 unit is bringing it down by 100-150 points.

Has anybody seen the ISF change so drastically and suddenly before?

Some observations:
1. This started around the time we went to the pump from MDI. 
2. We use Lily brand lispro in a vial in the pump instead of the kids humalog with the kwikpen. 
3. He did have a whole body allergic rash around the same time we went to the pump. A similar rash has happened a month ago too though when we were on MDI but his CF hadn‚Äôt changed this much back then.
4. No changes in his diet or activity level.
5. It could be honeymoon phase but weird that it would start/stop so suddenly and dramatically 2-3 months into diagnosis.

My suspicion is - could his body be having  a hyper sensitive reaction to insulin during those past couple days, perhaps related to the allergic rash? Or was the rash unrelated?

I‚Äôm worried his CF may dramatically increase again in future unexpectedly and cause him to have a severe low again. So would like to get to the bottom of this if any ideas.

Child Diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes,"Hello all,

My child was just diagnosed with type 1, and I am hoping to get some advice on apps to use for counting carbs. I intend on getting them a phone so they can install the app themselves and get in the habit of tracking throughout the day, but the only app I've tried so far is Carb Manager and I'm not liking it. Any recommendations are welcome, including advice on other aspects and things I likely haven't even thought of yet. 

This is all new, and terrifying, but I am doing my best to set them up for success so they can try to live their life as normally as possible. Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14n7qvj/child_diagnosed_with_type_1_diabetes/,"['Hey, I‚Äôve got an entire  booklet of information on T1D if you‚Äôd like to read it. It‚Äôs basically all the information I wanted to have at diagnosis but didn‚Äôt have access to an endocrinologist/diabetes team to ask questions so I researched my own. I‚Äôm happy to send you a copy.\n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nFor your specific question, I use Carbs&Cals. Not the 35¬£ a year one you have to pay for, it cost ¬£5 at first use and then it‚Äôs the basic package versuion. I‚Äôve also got the book version (same name) in case my phone ever fails or whatever. \n\nIts not the best app ever (because it‚Äôs the basic app, some brand name options are locked. Take Nutella, on the app the actual Nutella is locked, but it does offer alternatives- in this case ‚Äúchocolate hazelnut spread‚Äù) but it‚Äôs decent and does the job well enough. \n\nI‚Äôve heard Calorie King and MyFitnessPal are good. No personal experience.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nGeneral tips: \n\nThere are 42 known factors that affect how insulin reacts and responds to your blood sugar levels. We can account for only some of those- as such sometimes diabetes does really weird stuff and sometimes there is no pattern. \n\nhttps://diatribe.org/42-factors-affect-blood-glucose-surprising-update\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nDiabetes is a marathon not a sprint. There are good days and bad days and sometimes everything will go to pot and nothing will make sense. And that‚Äôs okay. Go to sleep, get back up and start the day off fresh the following day. \n\n‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs ok not to be ok (that‚Äôs for you as well, T1D parent) Dealing with a chronic illness is hard, supporting someone with a chronic illness is hard. Remember to cut yourself some slack. It‚Äôs ok not to be in range all the time, it happens. Just fix it, make a note of it and move on. \n\n‚Ä¶\n\nAnd this is probably the most important: your numbers for blood sugar are not good or bad. It‚Äôs data. That‚Äôs all- just data to inform you of your next move. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of good or bad, that only leads to stressing out over numbers (stress responses in the body also release cortisol and adrenaline which only increase your insulin resistance leading to higher blood sugar levels) and eventually burnout. You fix it, you note it down and you move on.\n\nFinally, document everything. If you eat carbs and dose for it, you write it down. Write blood sugars down before each meal and bedtime, if you can also get ones approx two hours after you finish eating as well (it gives the doctors ideas on dialing in your short acting insulin to carb ratios)', 'We like MyFitnessPal when our son was first diagnosed BUT, at 12, I might be iffy with it, as it also counts calories.', 'We use Calorie King to get carb information.

That will give you confidence.

Insulin doesn‚Äôt work at night?,"I‚Äôve noticed a recent trend I‚Äôve never asked anyone else about before. Does insulin work for you when you‚Äôre sleeping or lying down at night?

treating DKA at home?,"hi friends, I was diagnosed at age 4 and started on a pump at 6. I remember every now and then I‚Äôd get sick and my mom called it ketones and I‚Äôd stay home from school for a day, take corrections til my BG was down and drink lots of water til the ketones cleared and I stopped throwing up. In high school, I developed an allergy to the pump adhesives and often ripped them out in my sleep, so I was sick with ketones a lot, like once a month. Every time, I stayed home for a day, brought BG down, and drank ungodly amounts of water til i felt better. I thought nothing of this except that it was annoying so I switched to MDI and haven‚Äôt developed ketones since then.

When my brother was in the ICU in DKA, I kind of put 2 and 2 together and realized that what my mom was calling ketones was quite literally DKA. I always was scared of DKA and thought it was like ketones but 1000x worse, but now I see I was in DKA all of those times and didn‚Äôt know it. I know now that DKA is very serious and requires a hospital visit, but I‚Äôm wondering is it really so dangerous to treat at home by taking corrections and drinking water? I have always done it this way but I don‚Äôt want to put myself in danger if it‚Äôs risky. 

TLDR: is it bad to treat DKA at home and why? what does hospital do that can‚Äôt be done at home?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14natda/treating_dka_at_home/,"['You can have ketones without being in DKA.

I knew very little about diabetes at the time, and he was haphazardly managing it on his own uninsured in the before Obamacare days.  Even with insurance he‚Äôs still not great at managing, and we don‚Äôt really have enough money for him to use a pump or CGM with any consistency.  Poor guy has spent the last few years since Covid job hopping and changing insurance plans too much to ever meet the deductible and out of pocket so he can get a new pump (Thanks, Tandem, for abandoning the t:Flex).

Diabetes is a way bigger deal to us than it is for the people in our lives. It's all about perspective. Out perspective is from the one dealing with it, and for the 2 of us at least it's been most of our lives. We organize our time around it, we make decisions on what and when to eat because of it. And we never get a day off. It's always in the back of our minds,nif not the forefront at all times. Hell the first thing I do when waking up from a dead sleep is check my dexcom. Its on my mind before I'm even fully awake. It's become almost autopilot at this point. That's how we see it. And so it makes sense that it is this huge piece of baggage to us. \n\nNow your partner is gonna care, hopefully, but they're not gonna have it on their mind at all times. My wife knows enough for emergency situations but aside from that, i take care of everything myself. She doesn't have to think about it 24/7 like i do. So outside of times when I'm changing pods or sensors, having a low, or taking a bolus it's out of her mind. I think most non diabetics will be similar when in a relationship with a diabetic. \n\nLemme put it another way that might help. Do you personally think it would be harder to date someone with let's say Epilepsy?  Just like most diabetics I know, a lot of epileptics have learned what triggers them and what they can and can't do. So if you were to date someone with it, who has it mostly under control, would it be hard for you to get past? Would it be too much worry for you? The answer is gonna be different for everyone."", 'My partner is diabetic.  It‚Äôs not a big deal in terms of our relationship together.  You are so much more than this disease you have.  It‚Äôs just one part of what makes up you.  If a potential partner doesn‚Äôt seem ok with it, they aren‚Äôt the right one for you.  I don‚Äôt know if it specifically makes it harder for dating but realistically day to day for most part there are only minor inconveniences - like waiting to eat or changing plans due to levels.  If they can‚Äôt show you empathy for these very minor things I‚Äôd question if they have capacity at all to deal with any hard things - they‚Äôd be a bad partner regardless of your illness.', ""It can be.

Being a diabetic in Switzerland (Valais),"Hello,

Trulicity to Ozempic,"Three questions folks:

1.	Could anyone share their experiences using trulicity as a T1?
2.	Has a pharmacist ever denied you a semglutide, dulaglutide, or tirzepatide med due to being a T1 (not a T2)?
3.	Has anyone started on trulicity and then switched to ozempic? Did you notice any changes?

For some context: I‚Äôm in shape, but only because of my extremely mentally-taxing control of diet and activity (my point being it certainly does not come naturally to me). I am also recovering from BED. And, I am quite insulin resistant despite eating low carb and exercising 6x a week.

"Scared of lows, it's messing me up bad.","The anxiety that low blood sugar has caused me over the past couple of months is really messing with my head and I'm messing up my numbers.

Last December I had a really bad low, chugged a coke and all I remember is waking up on the side of my bed, no memory of getting into bed or falling asleep. 

Ever since then my A1C has slowly been creeping up. From 6.2 to 6.9 and I bet if I were tested right now I'd be in the mid 7's.

I've been waking up around the 200's because I'm scared of going low. Ever since I started my keto diet it seems like even one unit of insulin will cause me to drop dramatically. Is this insulin resistance? 

I see my sugar dropping fast and I'm terrified it's not going to level out. I've been a diabetic for years and this new found fear of mine is really throwing me into a severe burnout that's going to lead to complications.

Any advice?

Keep us posted on your outcomes."", 'I can answer this because I\'ve been dealing with it for the last few years. There was a point when I had severe anxiety and was having frequent panic attacks over going low, constantly checking my sugar and eating sugar at the first sign of a low. I would get in these states of derealization where I felt disconnected mentally in a strange way. I barely felt safe in my home surrounded by snacks, let alone outside. There was a few things that helped me to get to where I am now. Sometimes I still get upset over the BS, but I would say I\'m mostly past all that and feeling normal again on the daily.\n\nFirst, I think the biggest cause of my anxiety was due to overall poor health and lifestyle choices. I often stayed up late, I\'d smoke weed which feels similar to a low in some ways, I wasn\'t eating healthy, wasn\'t exercising enough, too much sex with ejaculation that\'s depleting nutrients, too much screen time. All things that were wearing me down physically in addition to blood sugar swings. Diabetes is stressful, and when the body is in a poor state of health, our ability to cope with that stress isn\'t as good. So I started changing those bad habits, and while I\'m still far from perfect, getting healthier made me a lot more resilient and able to cope with the BS of diabetes. Eating good quality veggies and meats, taking good nutritional supplements, going outside for walks even when I was extremely anxious sometimes, getting enough sleep each night, etc. all helped to improve my confidence and reduce my anxiety. \n\nAs a side note on the keto diet, just my own opinion based on how my body works, even though I eat low carb, my body definitely still needs some amount of carbs every day. If I avoid all carbs my blood sugar goes on a roller coaster where any carbs spike me up and any insulin crashes me hard. So I need to eat with insulin regularly to keep food fueling me and create stability.\n\nSecond, like others have mentioned, going on a pump. I\'m also super sensitive to insulin, especially if I\'ve been physically active which is the main thing that affects my insulin sensitivity. The pump allows me to take much smaller doses, and I do take like 0.5 or 0.25 sometimes. I don\'t usually take more than 3 or so units at any time, I eat pretty low carb, and I spent a while fine tuning my diet for things that are generally easy on my blood sugar. Also the CGM is a blessing and curse, because constantly looking at the readings can definitely cause anxiety. I had diabetes for years before this anxiety about lows became such a problem, and I think constantly worrying over my CGM trends played a major part in that anxiety developing, versus things just happening without me watching all the time. So I had to learn to let things go a bit, and while that was mostly a mental and emotional thing, the tandem pump with Control IQ did help a lot particularly while sleeping overnight. As long as I don\'t eat right before bed, thanks to Control IQ sleep mode I basically wake up every morning around 100 since I got the pump over a year ago, and that alone is a huge relief instead of timing and adjusting the long acting insulin for overnights and not being fully sure where I\'d wake up at. Knowing the amount of insulin on board is also a critical piece of info I rely on throughout the day.\n\nThird, I honestly just had to give things time. I didn\'t stop being constantly afraid of lows quickly. I would say I gradually got better and more confident/ comfortable over a period of a few months to a couple years. Not saying it has to take that long, but a big part of it was just continuing to live and experiencing occasional lows and dealing with them. Remembering how they feel and convincing myself over time I can take care of them. Now I\'m like I really hate lows and don\'t want to go low, but I don\'t get super anxious thinking about them or anything.\n\nI think about my blood sugar like this, and it\'s not trying to convince myself or anything, its just a logical thought process based on past experience: ""Based on how much insulin I\'ve taken recently, how much and what kind of food I\'ve eaten recently, and what physical activity I\'ve done recently, I have a pretty good idea of how much momentum my blood sugar could have in either direction. If I think I\'m actually heading low, time for a juice box, that shits my best friend lately, boom. Usually that\'s good, if that\'s not enough, I\'ll get some fruit snacks / granola bar / extra carbs on board to give my body more fuel to level out from whatever insulin or activity is sending me low. If I go low, that sucks and feels like shit but now I know based on the momentum I\'ve thought through that this shouldn\'t be a serious low and it will come back up, I\'ll be fine."" \n\nHopefully that\'s some helpful info, and just know others like myself are going through this same exact stuff. Lots of times I feel alone out of everyone I know, but here you are going through the same stuff as me. So I feel you for sure, and feel free to reach out anytime for the support you need. Take care, blessings of light and love friend.', 'I‚Äôve had a similar experience to you. It lead to me having an average of 160 for a few weeks, because I was so incredibly afraid of lows. There was one time where I had given me an insulin dose of 4 units when I was high and I had to drink over a litre of juice to fight the low‚Ä¶and even after that I still felt extremely low and head a bs around 50 , it didn‚Äôt want to go up at all. I was alone outside and was so afraid I would randomly pass out and people might not help me fast enough. \nAlso, I was just so full and didn‚Äôt feel like I could keep eating or drinking without throwing up. \n\nThat was about over a year ago.

But I completely understand your feelings.', 'I really suffered with this a few years ago and I felt like I would never get hold of my body. I found that easing out of keto and into a low carb diet helped get more stability as the carbs kept me up longer. I also experimented with having meals that required more insulin in the safety of my home with someone there who could monitor and forcing myself to wait it out unless I actually went low. Gradually I started to trust myself again but the anxiety was triggered the same way yours was. It‚Äôs slow and takes time but you have to just become reacquainted with your levels again and be kind to yourself because it is a scary condition to have to manage', 'It is very common for anxiety to kick in because of a low blood sugar that caused a severe event. \n\nI try to correct a little early. If I am at lets say 110 headed down. I will drink 1/4 (a quarter can of soda). . Remember to wait 15 to 20 minutes to see it it helped. It you need more you still have time to drink more if needed. Set your low alert to 100 or 110 it gives you enough time to catch it and correct it.  Don‚Äôt ignore the low alert when sleeping get up and correct it right away.  A lot of people take too much when they correct a low blood sugar. Most of the time it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt catch it early enough.

Adjusting insulin ratios and basal would be the first step in the right direction. Furthermore, this would be a logical first step because OP said after using short acting insulin blood sugar drops significantly, suggesting too much insulin ""seems"" to be the driving force in the low. \n\nSince keto is a very specific diet and I assume OP wouldn\'t want to compromise the system - looking at changing insulin ratio and basal would be much more effective without changing diet or other factors.\n\nEdit: gluconeogenisis also happens in the body and needs no glucose intake to occur.

How you guys cope?,"
Hi,
I just found out about this sub, and I would like to know how you guys cope with this disease. I got diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 6 years ago. To be honest, I didn't care that much then. I thought I would just be injecting insulin three times a day, so what? But as time went on, things got harder. People started feeling extra pity for me, and I found myself overthinking every extra bite I wanted to have, which caused a lot of anxiety. The doctors told me back then that there was nothing to worry about and that I could continue living a normal life like other people, but that turned out to be a big lie.

My mental health is struggling as well. Recently, I went out with a couple of friends who don't know about my illness. We ended up eating lots of sweets (sometimes I can't control myself and mess up big time). There was one friend who noticed how much I was into sweets that day, and she said, ""Be careful, mate, or you'll end up having diabetes."" I replied, ""I already have it,"" and then she said, ""You mean you're in the danger zone; it's not like you're using insulin. That shit is messed up."" I said, ""Don't worry; it won't happen.""

When I was diagnosed, doctors advised my family to take me to a therapist because they thought I might struggle with accepting the fact that I was ill. I declined the suggestion, saying that I was fine. However, six years later, I realized deep down that I hadn't fully come to terms with having this disease and the reality that I must live with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mmpt1/how_you_guys_cope/,"['You can eat sweets if you bolus.

Can we please stop acting like this disease doesn‚Äôt keep us from doing things?,"This might be controversial but I don‚Äôt care. I have to let this out somehow. 

I know some of us are more easily managed than others, but this disease is considered a disability for a reason. It‚Äôs disabling. It hinders my ability to do things and sometimes keeps me from doing them altogether because it either wouldn‚Äôt be worth it due to the blood sugar problems it would cause me or I am physically unable to do it at all any more. We have to live our lives differently than other people and it does limit us sometimes.

I‚Äôm actually getting really tired of everyone acting like diabetes makes you just like everybody else except you take insulin, because it‚Äôs not true for most of us, especially those of us with hormonal influences or imbalances that interfere with it even further. God forbid you have any other cooccurring illnesses on top of the diabetes, that can make it even worse. 

No, I don‚Äôt want to be ostracized because I‚Äôm chronically ill, but I also don‚Äôt want people who don‚Äôt understand the challenges and ramifications of this disease thinking that I can do anything I want and throw caution to the wind but choose not to, or for them to think that I‚Äôm overreacting or something. Plus it makes me feel like I have to push through whatever diabetes is throwing at me to do whatever thing I wanted to do, which then makes it feel like I‚Äôm giving up if I stop/can‚Äôt do the thing and have to take care of myself.

I‚Äôm not trying to be a downer or anything but this specifically is really starting to wear me down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ls5x4/can_we_please_stop_acting_like_this_disease/,"['Amen!

You do need to check your blood sugar when driving and stop if you are going low. You do have crap days where you suddenly need much less insulin than you've injected yourself with, and you have to spend all day snacking to stop yourself going low. If you have an important meeting, or a job interview, you worry about going low during it. You do constantly feel like your future health depends on the decisions you make now. When you're pregnant, you constantly feel like your baby's health depends on the decisions you make now. \n\nAll this stuff does grind people down and we should be OK admitting that. If I don't want to go for a run today because my blood sugar hss been low all day, and it would just be work to keep it at an OK level, giving in to that doesn't make me a failure, it doesn't make me a bad diabetic.

There is not much you cannot do, but you are right, just because you can does not mean you can all the time.

Brain fog and just feeling straight up like crap when your BG is high is limiting!

I had a triple tib/fib fracture, one break being compound. The way I tried to stop myself from falling, I landed terribly. I had about 5 surgeries for that whole shitshow, ended up with rods and screws from knee to ankle. In 2016, I broke my right knee cap by slipping and falling on a greasy floor at Wendy's. I landed on my knee, on the tile floor. So I needed surgery immediately. Not onky did I break the patella, I tore my patellar tendon in half. They removed 1/3 of ny knee cap that was shattered and I have Kevlar implants permanently. Good times lol. Then in 2019, I had a low bs while driving. I was less than .5 miles from home. I woke up to being pulled out of my brand new, 1 month old car by firemen. So from that mess, I shattered my left leg for the 2nd time and now have permanent rods and screws in the same bones I broke the 1st time. I broke my left arm and have 2 plates, permanently. I also broke 11 ribs, front and back. I was in a wheelchair for a few months after since I couldn't use crutches and my other leg was weak from the knee cap incident.

Any tips for injecting before/after sport?,"For context, I've only recently been diagnosed. I'm still trying to nail down an ICR for meal bolus and I'm just using a consistent basal each day.

"Scary morning loss of vision, what next? (M23)","

Woke up yesterday with a flashing like spot in my vision. I had slept for 11 hours after a physical day at work, skipped dinner went straight to bed. (Active duty army) Anything I focused on didn‚Äôt seem to exist. My peripheral vision was decent enough to cause me to remain at least a little calm. (I‚Äôve noticed in the past where I feel shaky and anxious having a cup of juice helps.)

I tried to get along with my day, but after showering my entire vision starting flickering. Things started to get worse and I got more anxious.I laid back in a state of panic about to make the call to go to the hospital. I made the correlation that my body does weird things sometimes and sugar seems to help. I grabbed a frozen sugar pop and within 30 seconds to a minute I was back to normal. 

I know I should probably go make an appointment urgently as I have some type of sugar issue.

Will Dexcom send you a replacement sensor even if you use an 'incompatible phone' and BYOD?,"So I inserted a G7 sensor today and my phone just won't find it to pair, was trying for over a half hour.

Inserted another sensor in the other arm and it paired immediately.

It's clearly the sensor itself that was faulty and I'd like to ring Dexcom and get it replaced, but I'm worried that if they ask what phone I have or the fact that I use Build Your Own Dexcom to make it work, they'll blame it on that and not send me a new one because of compatibility issues even though that's definitely not it.

Maybe you can relate,"I was dignosed at 8 when my teacher talked with my mom about how often I had been asking to go to the restroom. My mom, fortunately, correctly recognised it as a sign of diabetes.

Listening to a friend of a friend's wife:
""My husband cured it with dieting and mineral water. Look it up but the mineral water just has to be sourced from Malaysia""
Me: ""Did he have type 1?""
Her: ""I think it was type 1... Yeah, I think so.""

Another conversation with a rando:
""Oh, I could never take insulin, I hate needles.... You prick your finger how many times a day?""

In the hospital, when I was diagnosed at 8yrs old, I called it ""diet-beebees"". I saw my parents were worried so I tried to lighten the mood by joking ""I may have the BBs but I dont have the gun!"" It doesnt make much sense looking back, but I was 8 and my parents loved how much I took it all in good humor. I tried to take it well and I think it made them feel more at ease.

Cut to me as a kid, still at the hospital being observed for a few days after first being diagnosed:

My elementary school class all wrote letters to me, some innocently saying ""feel better!"" or ""Get well soon"" but it was still sweet and meant a lot to me that they did that and that the teacher initiated that.

The nurse also let me play a videogame. It was the one and only Captain Novolin on the SNES.

Constant fatigue + recent weight loss - high sugar level symptoms?,"Hi all!

I've always been quite fatigued since being diagnosed, but the past couple months has been ROUGH, every day I could nap halfway through.

My sugar levels definitely are sitting higher and I struggle to get them down recently. Usually sitting above 10 and spike up to 20. I take insulin, it goes down, then it goes back up. Very annoying.


Recently, I noticed I've dropped around 5kg in about a month. Now, I have been eating slightly healthier and less food in general, but thats thats a lot. (Gone from 104.8 to 99.9, roughly.)

Could a higher HB1AC be causing this? Just did the blood test this morning, so waiting on results, but I definitely know it's higher. Clarity app even puts it around 8.9% for past 3 months.


Sorry for the word spew, but could the constant higher sugar levels be causing my extreme fatigue and weight loss?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14lwz3d/constant_fatigue_recent_weight_loss_high_sugar/,"['Yes, its a possibility. If you‚Äôre blood sugar levels are elevated, especially over 200-220, for prolonged periods of time you will notice weight loss and fatigue.

Your ratios might need some adjusting!', ""Check your ketones if possible. If you're constantly high on BGs, you may be developing too many ketones.

Not 100% on the conversion but I assume thats similar to what I've said.\n\nHonestly no idea what mine was when diagnosed, but last time it was.... 7.2%? which is still high but it come down, though this was.. 8 months ago. I'm worried it has jumped way up.\n\nGlad to hear (I guess?) you think it's possible, especially for the weight loss. There was a moment where I gained a LOT of weight because I increased my insulin, almost 15kg. \n\nI'll have to wait for results and discuss with my doctor then!""]"
