I don’t deserve to be put down because of a disease that I randomly got ( first one to get it in my family ) I haven’t talked to her in a week and she been trying to apologize but I don’t wanna hear it I told her we’re done because what was said really hurt me and I can’t look at her the same  did I do the right thing ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14pr1tp/heartbroken_fuck_being_diabetic/,She doesn’t deserve you if her reaction was “I didn’t sign up for this”…… honestly dodged a bullet. Your partner should support you thru highs and lows (no pun intended)

That being said I am a human who has said many ignorant and out of line things in highly emotional states. We are all human and watching someone you care about struggle is hard. Some people deal with that by shutting themself off emotionally so they don't have to feel it. People change and grow and learn especially in relationships. Only you can know if you did the right thing or not.

A T1 diagnosis is traumatic.

First few weeks are awful, especially if your start was DKA.

First year has steep learning curve.

Then it gets better. Much better.

Your gf could have been scared. People do and say very ugly things when scared. Both sides.

Or she may have shown her hand in that she is not ready to commit long term come what may.

You know her character better, you know if you want to keep and build what you have, or walk away. 

Your gf does not know that this is what a year later brings:

Bad shit happens to everyone, it's just a matter of time. When you raise a child with someone, you have to trust that they will be there for you and your child. She has clearly shown that she will give up or not help when it is inconvenient for her.

My son is 6 and was just diagnosed with T1D. Thankfully, his mother and I are willing to do whatever it takes to keep him healthy. I have seen too many couples learn that one of them is a selfish, heartless piece of shit *after* their child was born. In my opinion, if you plan to have children, a partner that you can rely on is one of the most important aspects of a relationship. You now have to opportunity to find someone better."

In this case, diabetes is the wingman that freed you from harpy of epic proportions. Cut her out. I'd rather produced diabetic kids than ones with mega-twat genes and I'm sure most others feel the same.

I am sorry you are T1D, but thrilled you unloaded an unworthy partner. I hope you bounce back fast and spend your summer meeting tons of potential girlfriends."

If she “didn’t sign up to have a sick kid”, then she shouldn’t sign up to have kids, PERIOD.

What would she do if the (hypothetical) kid got leukemia instead of diabetes? Return it? 

You’ve been through two pretty huge traumas in a very short time. Your focus right now should be on you: getting your diabetes in to a rhythm, figuring out how to navigate the health system, and for the love of Pete, find yourself a therapist. Just trust me on this."

Pretty sure they were ecstatic to stick me with needles as we got used to a new lifestyle. 

It is an absolutely monster change to just start needing insulin every meal of every day and more. Two years in and I still am learning all the things, so it understandably was quite a shock to both of you with the mountain of information. 

That said, it’s pretty scary to be with someone that will run when things get difficult. I wouldn’t say you are left with nothing, but you gained a valuable lesson into the kind of partner you want and need in the future."

You need someone who is going to support you, no matter what. For her to prefer to be in a relationship with someone who isn't able to be well is a red flag.

I was married for 4 years prior to my diagnosis. I say this because the side-effects of my uncontrolled (and undiagnosed) hyperglycemia was a major point of contention in our marriage. Low sex drive, exhaustion at the end of the day, waking her up cause I had to pee 4x a night for years, atrophy, etc... It wasn't until the diagnosis came along that we were actually able to start repairing our relationship. We didn't know there was a 3rd partner in our relationship. Recognizing that hidden partner ultimately led to us learning which tools were needed to make things better. In short, the diagnosis, while very traumatic in itself, is a blessing to the victim and the ones they surround themselves with."

We ended up getting married and having another kid. We were together from my age 15-30. He knew me before dx and was absolutely unsupportive of my health the entire time (comparing me to other people (read:T2D who have very little in common with T1D), never going to a Dr's appointment,  complaining about the cost of insulin, so on and so forth). He also ""didn't sign up for this"" ONLY HE DID. I won't forget how I was treated and my family won't forgive it. 
My next boyfriend was better support but my health did come into play. What were to happen during pregnancy (my pregnancies in my 20s were horrendous, what would it be like in my 30s? What if I have a seizure with a newborn?). But in my opinion, these are valid questions and as just a boyfriend, it would have been ok for him to back out of the relationship.  I really don't fault and it sucked at the time...but if he didn't support me when I was still healthy, what would have happened if I did lose my vision or my feet? I think the resentment would have just kept snowballing. Again, while it was painful, it was alright. 

My current boyfriend just accepts diabetes as a part of me as much as my eye color. He loves me for me and we deal with my health as needed. I've never felt more supported- which leads me to take better care of myself, which allows me to move forward in my career and be the parent I want to be.

All of this is a long-winded way to say, once you find the right person, everything will fall into place. And for the wrong people, they can fuck right off."

My kid is the T1. Did I expect this? No. Am I sad my child has to deal with this? Yes. Did I know or even think this would happen? No. 

But I sure as shit signed up for it. I signed up to be his mom and I signed up for the good the bad and the ugly. And this isn’t always pretty. 

And if my son came to me and told me his girlfriend said that I would tell him at least she showed her ass now. 

You deserve someone who will go through it with you and be your partner, support system and cheerleader in all things. All the beautiful and ugly aspects of life. She’s not that someone."

She never gave a shit about you so if you did get married then clearly she wouldn’t have followed the standard “in sickness and in health” bit.

As a human being i hope you can stay strong in your decission to end this relationship, for your own good, if there is no other things that could balance this in her favour. 

I will short tell you my story. This month will be 3 years since my diagnosis. I am still learning and adapting because i was one year and a half only on glucometer and pens, after that sensors and pens and now im 3 months with pump. Looking back, a lot of adjustments that made diabetes the central point of my life and fear to give my best at work to not get fired. 

Going back to the impact that the diagnosis has on my relationship, at first, he seemed scared and became ipohondric. After one year, we had tickets for a big music festival and i went 1st day, the 2nd my bgs were really bad and only suggesting that i might not go i have started a ""fire"" and heard things like, i am ruining other people s plans and like i was an obstacle for people. I really felt this is not something i could ever forgive... i was like sorry if my diabetes bothers you so much...

I went to therapy. The therapist told me if i have ever asked him how did he felt my diagnosis, because he was caring and supportive for a while and i felt very selfish as i realised that it didnt occur to me. As diabetes is not only our diagnosis, is a fear that impacts all people that have love for us. Maybe in some way was better for me as i had to be the one in control. 

Nevertheless, almost 3 years later he has no respect for many things diabetes related... as my sleep...this is a constant reason to fight... i an sorry i didnt end it after that festival.

Im telling you this because i dont know your gf, maybe she reacted out of fear, and totally messed up with you...or maybe you are in my shoes too and need to hear that people dont change. 

People with diabetes that i know they live a happy life have caring and supportive partners, that show understanding and makes them feel less lonely..."

You’ll get there, it will just be with someone better and more worthy of you. 

Also just a side note, if shots are a difficult you can try insulin pens or a pump. So much easier than shots. 

I am sorry for your loss. Sometimes we have to deal with crap to get to better times. You will get there."

It’s painful and complicated because I understand their point of view but it’s soul crushing for self esteem

Edit: that being said I am hopefully getting an insulin pump in two days time. At least i am progressing individually in some sense and I know you can to"

He ended up living 1 yr and 10 days after diagnosis. Not a single finger was lifted by either of my brothers to help until the last 3 days of the man’s life. Fuck people like that. Who needs em!

Not sure of your insulin reliance but ozempic can help a lot by increasing insulin output, reducing appetite, and increasing insulin sensitivity by losing weight, so it may help lengthen your honeymoon period."

If someone posted on this board saying that they were dating someone who just picked up a T1 diagnosis and was being this co-dependent so early on I would advise them to run for the hills.  

Your girlfriend wants to imagine the person she is with as a strong and capable person able to be a brick to build a family on not an anchor she is going to have to pull through the mud."

I will straight up tell you, I would’ve done the same thing as you. 
To play devils advocate, it could’ve just been a moment of frustration. If she’s helping you out a ton, she too might be overwhelmed and scared.
But flip it- if she ended up being diagnosed would you have felt the same way towards her? Doubtful. To say she doesn’t want to have kids with you because they’ll be sick too is just plain cruel.

Sorry that it happened to you because it shouldn’t have but better now than way late. PS don’t worry. When you’re ready to get back out there, there are going to be plenty of people who won’t even bat an eye when you tell them you’re diabetic.  The good ones never do. If they do, easy red flag and you know what to do!

Edit to add: type 1 gets a lot easier the longer you have it and while none of us will ever be experts you’ll learn how your body will likely do something and it won’t feel like a burden forever. Sorry for the recent diagnosis though! No matter what never a fun thing to hear."

You’re going to have rough, rough diabetes days right after a really good one or vice versa. You can either beat yourself over the rights or wrongs, or you can take a bit of consideration of the past, or look ahead. Clean slate. Figure out the next three hours."

It's important to approach this with empathy and maturity. While assistance with insulin injections can be challenging, it's essential to become self-sufficient in managing treatment. Seek support from healthcare professionals or loved ones who can provide guidance.

Regarding hereditary diabetes, it's best to focus on the present rather than worrying about something that may or may not happen in the future. Take time to clear your head and re-evaluate what you want in a relationship. Open and honest communication, considering both perspectives, can help in understanding each other better.

Ultimately, prioritize your emotional well-being and surround yourself with supportive people. They can provide valuable guidance during this challenging time."

There’s also a chance that stress and fear led to blunt honesty.  Deep down she knows why she said what she said.  The question is are you willing to hear her out, believe her, or move beyond what she said?  You don’t have to.  If what she said is unforgivable you walk away.  If you think you can move forward maybe you try maybe you don’t.  If this is something that will always lurk in the back of your mind it’s probably best to walk away."

She’ll be an ass for the rest of your life about it. And men that carry T1D have a 1 in 17 chance of giving it to their kids. She’ll always hold it against you if your kid is diabetic.

The dka t1d path is not a fun one. Take care of your health best you can, there is a lot to learn. A lot of misguided advice will come your way and it’s hard to tell good from bad. This group is helpful though tbh.

Next, sorry about your girlfriend, that’s some high stress to add to the whole thing. As others said, people say wild things when under a lot of stress, even unforgivable things imo can be forgiven. I have no idea the relationship y’all have or had, but another tenet of long term relationships is not holding onto words, especially said out of anger/stress/fear. It happens. Even if y’all don’t reconcile, best let it go either way. People don’t start out enlightened, it takes life experience sometimes, and maybe she hasn’t had those experiences yet. And a lot of us could do a lot better when feeling emotional…

It is possible she isn’t the one for you, and vice versa, and as sad as that probably feels to you right now, it is a possibility. You can’t control that, you can’t act a certain way to convince someone to be right for you (and vice versa), and at some point accepting that is going to empower you to be strong and live your life as the person you want to be.

My suggestion is to focus on taking care of your health, embrace all the T1D changes coming your way, even more radical changes you may or may not be feeling yet (like low carb diet options to go along with your injections, new exercise plans, etc.) It takes a while to learn how all the new things work together, I’m still learning (dx’ed in April) too. The CGMs aren’t perfect, but they’re still great. Meds aren’t great, but help. Diet actually does huge things, for me anyway.

As you learn the new world for you, you’ll develop as a person too. Let that guide your next steps. If it works out with your ex-gf, great, and if not then that could be great too. But I’d really suggest letting go any emotional words, it doesn’t help to hang onto it. Find your strength first. Then the rest will come.

*Idealistic maybe, but good luck however things go from here!*"

If I cut everyone out of my life every time they said something hurtful that they really shouldn't have said due to stress and anger, or if they cut me off every time I said something hurtful that I shouldn't have said when I wasn't dealing with stress very well, I would be a very lonely person right now.

If both of you are willing to apologize to each other and learn to deal with this new normal, then I don't see why you two can't make up with each other. But you are going to need to apologize for the things you said, and accept her apology for what she said (if she apologizes), since you both said some really hurtful things you shouldn't have.

But you're going to need to step up too:

* You probably need some mental/emotional help or counseling. You are literally dealing with grief as the life you once knew and expected is over, and now the rest of your life is going to be very different in many ways. Going through the various stages of grief, anger, etc., is pretty normal, but you'll need to work through it and get on with living your best life. Counseling can help with this.
* You need to learn to manage your condition on your own as much as possible, and being able to deal with checking your own blood sugar is a pretty minimally low bar, imho. You'll need to learn to count carbs, calculate bolus, manage your basal, correct for lows and highs, etc., as well. A diabetes educator can help a lot with this. A partner should be supportive and can help in this, but the responsibility lies with you.
* You both need to understand the T1D is not a death sentence. It's completely manageable and you can still do just about everything a non-diabetic can do, but it will require extra work and preparation for a lot of things that you used to be able to do without thinking (i.e. eating, exercise, etc.).
* And it *definitely* doesn't mean your children will be T1D. There is some statistical correlation in that someone with a T1D parent does have a higher probability of becoming T1D themselves, but it's not a simple dominant/recessive genetic trait or anything. A genetic counselor can help you understand the potential risks."

That is about 5.5%. You could easily have 12 non diabetic children, or you could have 3 children, and they could all be diabetic, but the odds are with the first option. My parents had 4 children, and 2 of us are T1. Neither of them is diabetic. Diabetes is also not a death sentence. People live full and rewarding lives, our life expectancy is about the national average (no specific numbers, but we tend to eat healthier, exercise more regularly, and visit the doctor more often than most people, giving us advantages that balance with the instances of premature death), we can do and be pretty much anything (though currently any hopes of a military career are still dashed), and being diabetic does not need to limit us. As tech improves, so do our day to day lives, career opportunities, long-term health, the mental and emotional burden of being diabetic, and everything else. This is a good time to be diabetic, and tomorrow will be even better!

I agree with the comment that I am replying to that you may each want to cut each other some slack. A diagnosis can be as hard, or sometimes even harder, on those that love us than it is on us. We are dealing with grief but, especially with a new diagnosis, spend much of our time and energy learning how to survive. Our loved ones immediately begin the grieving process, including anger, denial, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. This is not a simple process, and it is easy to lash out. I would recommend sitting down and talking with your partner. You may not be willing to try again, but at least clearing the air and making peace with each other would be healthy for you both. 

If you decide to give your ex another chance, I think counseling might be good for you both. I don't know if such a thing exists, but a family or couples counselor with experience dealing with chronic health issues could be very helpful. Otherwise, a grief counselor would be my recommendation to help you both process your feelings about diagnosis. 

I understand your pain from not getting the support you need from your partner. I have been with my boyfriend for almost 16 years, but recently, he has been less than supportive of some of my newer health issues. It is hard to decide where to give slack and where to draw the line on a long-term serious relationship. You have a lot invested in a 4 year relationship, so I think you should give it a chance personally. There are things that can be unforgivable and others that are said in the heat of the moment and regretted almost immediately. Losing your health is as bad as losing a close family member or friend when it comes to the grieving process. Anger and lashing out at others is a normal part of the grieving process. 

It's up to you if you are willing to hear her out and if you are willing to give it another try. Neither of you is in a good head space at this time to make long-term decisions. I hope one way or another, everything works out well for you!"

The Unthinkable Happened,"Last Friday, my boss asked me to start only doing my diabetes care in bathrooms while working. I never thought I'd be asked to hide or keep the disease a secret. Apparently changing pump supplies and doing treatment (shots/testing when needed) makes people uncomfortable.

Some background: I work as a Phlebotomist for big-name lab company (it's one of the two you're probably thinking of). My job asks me to go into doctor's offices and collect samples, and I guess one of the offices was offended by me doing the normal pump supplies stuffs.

Their bathrooms are always dirty, without sharps containers, and for public use. While just in general gross, it's unsanitary to use those facilities for that purpose. Not to mention the ADA requirements being broken, and an approved reasonable accomodation from my HR department. 

What makes me the most upset is the thought that MY disability is making OTHERS uncomfortable. Like it just makes me feel like crap, and different when all I've done is work to get to a healthy A1C, weight, and normal life somewhat.

Now I'm feeling like I've been living life horribly underprepared lmao. I never bring pump supplies with me to work or school. I will bring stuff if I'm going to be away from home for like a whole day (lake day, road trip) but never just for work. Worst case scenario if I had a pump issue I would just leave work and deal with it at home but that happens very rarely. Same thing for insulin/CGM that all stays at home. My house is also only a 5 minute drive from my work so I suppose that influences things as well"
The Unthinkable Happened,"Last Friday, my boss asked me to start only doing my diabetes care in bathrooms while working. I never thought I'd be asked to hide or keep the disease a secret. Apparently changing pump supplies and doing treatment (shots/testing when needed) makes people uncomfortable.

Their bathrooms are always dirty, without sharps containers, and for public use. While just in general gross, it's unsanitary to use those facilities for that purpose. Not to mention the ADA requirements being broken, and an approved reasonable accomodation from my HR department.

That’s when insulin was discovered. 

I’m grateful I was diagnosed about 10 years ago, after CGMs and pumps were pretty common, and after scientists had had around 90 years to fine tune insulins. It was also after the development of human recombinant insulin, which isn’t nearly as problematic as porcine or bovine insulin. 

And glucose monitoring…also a fairly recent thing. Not until the 80s was it done widely at home, and even then…go to the Smithsonian and check out the Accuchek meter there. That thing is a dinosaur. Mine fits in the palm of my hand….and that’s not even accounting for my CGM. 

We’ve come a long way in the last century."

My Mom is an RN, having a parent who knew what to do/how to care for t1d was a huge advantage. My Dad had to learn a lot. He told me later on that when he started tearing up, watching me struggling, he walked out into the hallway so I didn't see him upset. Another Dad and his child, who had cancer came walking by. My Pop said that was very enlightening, that he didn't feel as bad about my situation. Also, my 1st endocrinologist told my parents not to worry, that there would be a cure within 10 years.

Thanks Olive Garden for being so inclusive 😊,,https://i.redd.it/fzqff2q0zl9b1.jpg,Back in the late 90s early 00s I would go to the mall & the restroom next to the food court had one of those sharps bins in it. I was amazed that someone had put that in there just for me. I needed to take my insulin & had nowhere to put my used syringe. It was much much later that it occurred to me that those were probably in there for the type of injections that shouldn’t be made in public…. I was so naive once upon a time. I really did think those were just for us diabetics.

"Hello, Im new here","TL'DR. Im new here. An observations it took me 30 years to realise. Total Calories determine Basal dosage. Changes to average daily calorie intake will cause ""unexplained"" highs and lows.

Hi all,

I'm new here so thought I'd introduce myself. 46 YO male, had T1D since 1990 at age 12.

I'm old school and still inject. Tresiba and Humalog but just added Fiasp to see how that works (and not sure it's any improvement on Humalog tbh). I use Libre 2. My control is good, maybe even excellent. My sister is T1D too (awesome family genetics) but she became T1 10 years ago.

I'm 94% on target on the Libre standard target, but I set my own target of 4mmol to 7.9mmol (72 to 142 for my North American cousins) and aim for 75% minimum and I get annoyed if it drops below that (god damn you any low reading Libre sensors, DO NOT F\*\*\* with my stats) . I've hit 78% of the last 3 months at 6.6mmol average and thats a few % better than usual.

I lift weights a few times a week and have been doing so for many years. This helps T1D in the long run, but nighttime after leg day can mean alarms and jelly babies. That double-edged sword of diabetes and exercise.

I don’t post online re diabetes or read that much either online about it but I thought to post this observation I've made over the last couple of years which has helped me and my sister. This is my experience. I'm not claiming this is science in any way, but from the little I do see online re T1D I don’t recall seeing this discussed. If it has been and is common knowledge apologies. Due to the fact that I inject a basal and bolus injection, it may not be relevant to other treatment regimens, or it might be.

I started to track everything I ate a couple of years ago in MyFitnessPal which was more for body composition/weight training but obviously benefits diabetes. I eventually realised my blood glucose levels jumped up or down the day or 2 after if I had eaten more or less than my average calories.

Eg, I’m aiming for 2600 calories and usually I'm within 200 calories either side of that, all is fine. But If I have a weekend and eat 3000, 3400 calories for a day or 2 then the days after my glucose would be high. The more calories the higher. And vice versa, If I had a day and was several 100 cals below my usual then id have more hypos.

I realised Basal is to calories what a Bolus is to carbs, albeit over a longer timescale.

My Tresiba ratio is 1unit per 100 calories. This varies on how much fat I carry, the season/ temperature, any exercise regime changes/ stress/sleep levels, but 100 calories per 1u is an appropriate guide for me. Two months ago I began  a fat loss diet (i do this a least yearly). Prior to that I’d been eating in a calorie surplus for a while, around 2800 calories average, while my basal ranged from 28 to 33 units.

Then I switched to a calorie controlled diet for 2 months to lose some fat. I titrated down to 19 units at 1900 calories a day.

A few days ago I began a break from the diet and consumed about 500 calories above the 1900 calorie diet average. Then the next day 4000 calories (beer, snacks, fatty foods). I’ve already had to increase my tresiba from 19 to 23 units as yesterday my glucose spiked like  I've not seen in the last few months. I didn’t do anything unusual on the day it was spiking (actually ate lowish calories/carbs), it was spiking because my basal dose wasn’t high enough to cope with the increase in calories in the previous 2 days. My target calories during my diet break are 2400 so I know that 23-24 units of Tresiba should do the trick whilst on the diet break. Then when I go back onto the diet and I know I'll hot 1900 calories i'll lower basal to 19u to avoid hypos that would happen leaving basal at 24 but lowering calories to 1900.

I’ve experienced this over and over in the last couple of years. Sometimes I can predict it and adjust before hand without them experiencing highs or lows. Sometimes not so accurate or a bit too hasty with changes.

Another observation. My body handles carbs easier when fat is relatively low ( 20% or less of total calories). I consumed between 350g to 400g of carbs daily during my calorie surplus. This is a decent amount for T1 however my BG was 4mmol and 7.9mmol (72 to 142) 75% of the time over 3 months and more. In the past few years, I have kept within my 4 to 7.9mmol 75% target and usually 94% target (4 to 10mmol).

There’s loads of info out there on how to control your diabetes but Im not sure this calorie / basal observation gets discussed. I could be wrong, I’m sure others have figured this out. However, I think it’s worth repeating as I think it can have a significant contribution to the impact of unexplained highs and lows and if sometimes calorie intake varies a lot day to day (like my sister) it may help understand the changes in BG readings that you then chase and get in to a glucose doom loop; eat, go high, rage bolus, go low, repeat. Keeping calories stable can help keep the basal stable and your glusone more predictable and less reactionary.

I hope this help someone out.

My HBA1C shows as 44mmol on the images whereas the phone app shows 39mmol and my blood test HB1AC is 39. Different Libre reports seem to have slightly different stats.

Cheers if you read this loooong post and hope you have a good day

I’ve had T1D for 30 years (dx’d 1992), and for a vast majority of that time I’ve just counted carbs. I was able to keep very decent control (A1c in the high 5s) with just carb counting and rage bolusing. It wasn’t until during my pregnancies that I was able to get tighter control, and discovered that I need to bolus for protein as well. I haven’t had an A1c in diabetic levels in over 6 years at this point."

Matching bolus to carb counting and protein always the main thing, this is really just an occasional thing to consider but if you're like me and  calories changes to surplus, deficit and maintenance periods it can help predict how to dose.  

I'd guess most people will naturally eat a maintenance level of calories that don't vary too much day to day but it may help explain some of those days when BG decides to freak out."
"Hello, Im new here","TL'DR. Im new here. An observations it took me 30 years to realise. Total Calories determine Basal dosage. Changes to average daily calorie intake will cause ""unexplained"" highs and lows.

Hi all,

I'm new here so thought I'd introduce myself. 46 YO male, had T1D since 1990 at age 12.

I'm old school and still inject. Tresiba and Humalog but just added Fiasp to see how that works (and not sure it's any improvement on Humalog tbh). I use Libre 2. My control is good, maybe even excellent. My sister is T1D too (awesome family genetics) but she became T1 10 years ago.

I'm 94% on target on the Libre standard target, but I set my own target of 4mmol to 7.9mmol (72 to 142 for my North American cousins) and aim for 75% minimum and I get annoyed if it drops below that (god damn you any low reading Libre sensors, DO NOT F\*\*\* with my stats) . I've hit 78% of the last 3 months at 6.6mmol average and thats a few % better than usual.

I lift weights a few times a week and have been doing so for many years. This helps T1D in the long run, but nighttime after leg day can mean alarms and jelly babies. That double-edged sword of diabetes and exercise.

I don’t post online re diabetes or read that much either online about it but I thought to post this observation I've made over the last couple of years which has helped me and my sister. This is my experience. I'm not claiming this is science in any way, but from the little I do see online re T1D I don’t recall seeing this discussed. If it has been and is common knowledge apologies. Due to the fact that I inject a basal and bolus injection, it may not be relevant to other treatment regimens, or it might be.

I started to track everything I ate a couple of years ago in MyFitnessPal which was more for body composition/weight training but obviously benefits diabetes. I eventually realised my blood glucose levels jumped up or down the day or 2 after if I had eaten more or less than my average calories.

Eg, I’m aiming for 2600 calories and usually I'm within 200 calories either side of that, all is fine. But If I have a weekend and eat 3000, 3400 calories for a day or 2 then the days after my glucose would be high. The more calories the higher. And vice versa, If I had a day and was several 100 cals below my usual then id have more hypos.

I realised Basal is to calories what a Bolus is to carbs, albeit over a longer timescale.

My Tresiba ratio is 1unit per 100 calories. This varies on how much fat I carry, the season/ temperature, any exercise regime changes/ stress/sleep levels, but 100 calories per 1u is an appropriate guide for me. Two months ago I began  a fat loss diet (i do this a least yearly). Prior to that I’d been eating in a calorie surplus for a while, around 2800 calories average, while my basal ranged from 28 to 33 units.

Then I switched to a calorie controlled diet for 2 months to lose some fat. I titrated down to 19 units at 1900 calories a day.

A few days ago I began a break from the diet and consumed about 500 calories above the 1900 calorie diet average. Then the next day 4000 calories (beer, snacks, fatty foods). I’ve already had to increase my tresiba from 19 to 23 units as yesterday my glucose spiked like  I've not seen in the last few months. I didn’t do anything unusual on the day it was spiking (actually ate lowish calories/carbs), it was spiking because my basal dose wasn’t high enough to cope with the increase in calories in the previous 2 days. My target calories during my diet break are 2400 so I know that 23-24 units of Tresiba should do the trick whilst on the diet break. Then when I go back onto the diet and I know I'll hot 1900 calories i'll lower basal to 19u to avoid hypos that would happen leaving basal at 24 but lowering calories to 1900.

I’ve experienced this over and over in the last couple of years. Sometimes I can predict it and adjust before hand without them experiencing highs or lows. Sometimes not so accurate or a bit too hasty with changes.

Another observation. My body handles carbs easier when fat is relatively low ( 20% or less of total calories). I consumed between 350g to 400g of carbs daily during my calorie surplus. This is a decent amount for T1 however my BG was 4mmol and 7.9mmol (72 to 142) 75% of the time over 3 months and more. In the past few years, I have kept within my 4 to 7.9mmol 75% target and usually 94% target (4 to 10mmol).

There’s loads of info out there on how to control your diabetes but Im not sure this calorie / basal observation gets discussed. I could be wrong, I’m sure others have figured this out. However, I think it’s worth repeating as I think it can have a significant contribution to the impact of unexplained highs and lows and if sometimes calorie intake varies a lot day to day (like my sister) it may help understand the changes in BG readings that you then chase and get in to a glucose doom loop; eat, go high, rage bolus, go low, repeat. Keeping calories stable can help keep the basal stable and your glusone more predictable and less reactionary.

I hope this help someone out.

The only time I notice that decrease affects me is during times of trying to lose weight, but that also leads to needing to decrease all of my insulin consumption, so that can be a double edge sword. I kept super tight control during my pregnancies to the point that I can at times feel like absolute garbage if I’m above 140-160. I personally have hated almost every Endo I’ve ever had, with one exception. My current Endo stays out of my business, prescribes what I want, runs the labs I ask for, and doesn’t pretend like she’s the one responsible for my successes and failures. And she isn’t in my business enough to care that I DIY loop. One visit with her physician partner after she moved to a new location had me driving 60 miles to her new location to avoid dealing with providers who are unable to understand that not all patients want or need their input."
"Type 1, fitness and, cortisol","I'm currently using cortisol nose spray for a chronic infection in my nose and working out semi regularly. 
So, today I got the following issue: before I go to the gym I ready a slice of bread (according to my experience and estimates it should raise the blood sugar to about 200 mg/dl). So I read about cortisol that it can raise the bg level. So, everything looked fine, until the bg did not stop rising and currently it is at about 300.

Did I simply miscalculate out is it the cortisol? Does anyone have experience with that sorta stuff? 

Thanx people ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14pme54/type_1_fitness_and_cortisol/,"Nobody can answer that with certainty, because there are simply too many variables at play, but here's my take.  

Cortisol and all corticosteroids result in increased insulin resistance.  That applies to basal insulin as well as bolus insulin, so it would affect your blood sugar no matter whether you normally injected insulin before your workout or simply relied on basal insulin already present in your system to account for the bread and keep your blood sugar at around 200.  

I would be willing to guess that it was probably the cortisol spray, especially if this is the first time you've used it and this is the first time this has happened, although it could also be in part your body's natural reaction to the inflammation in your nasal passages that you're using the cortisol for in the first place.  That inflammation can cause insulin resistance as well."

Or you are more resistant to insulin after you wake up, so of a pump, some increase their basal.

Researchers estimate prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in the US,,https://www.aop.org.uk/ot/science-and-vision/research/2023/06/19/researchers-estimate-prevalence-of-diabetic-retinopathy-in-the-us,"For research purposes this data may be useful but to the average diabetic this is just a bad news dumb. Statistics about complication prevalence are meaningless to the individual because complications are tied to high blood sugar rather than having diabetes itself. So even though the overall prevalence of retinopathy is 26%, the chances for the individual may be significantly lower or higher."

You are still not wrong, the individual risk is different from the statistical risk. And also we still do not know everything about all the risk factors."

Questions about low blood sugar,"Hello Everyone, first time poster.  
i've had diabetes since I was 3 and will be turning 31 soon. So i've had experience with it for a very long time. However there is so much of it that feels like a mystery.

I take Lantus for my night shot and humalog kwikpen on a 10 gram carb scale, and 1 unit for every 50 units of glucose above 150.

Now the libre isn't always accurate and some of this is my fault for not pricking myself to get a more accurate reading. I was just very groggy and not thinking. I gave myself 2 units of humalog.  An hour later my blood sugar dropped. I usually have those welch fruit snacks when my blood sugar drops. Each packet is about 17 grams of carbs. Well Last night I had to eat about 9 servings just to stabilize it.  Can anyone explain why I had to eat about 170 grams of carbs to get my glucose up when I only injected myself 2 units?

Pump choice,"Hi all!

I am finally deciding to get a pump, and looking for one that will be integrated with a CGM.

My endo provided me with two options: the tslim x2 that goes with the dexcom g6, or the minimed 780g that goes with the guardian 3 (soon to be guardian 4).

I just wanted to see if any of you had advice or experience with these that you'd like to share to help me make my decision! 

I have an appointment with pump specialists next week as well to get more understanding of the basics :)

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14plko7/pump_choice/,"Your endo forgot option #3, OmniPod 5 with Dexcom.  OmniPod is tubeless and for some people that’s important.  Others don’t care about the tubing.

You will get many responses telling you to stay away from Medtronic.  Many people have had bad experiences with their sensors, and the algorithm on their older pumps wasn’t very good.  They just came out with the 780g & Guardian 4 sensors but not many people in the United States have gotten it yet so you won’t see much about it yet.  The Guardian 4 sensors do not require daily calibrations.  It’s been available in Europe for a couple of years and people seem to really like the 780g there.

Tandem’s Control IQ is better than the old Medtronic algorithm, but again you won’t see many comparisons to the 780g yet.  Tandem works based off your own settings while Medtronic is supposed to learn your needs and adjust everything on its own.  OmniPod 5 is similar in that it is supposed to learn your needs, but it only adjusts basal and will not do automatic corrections like Tandem and Medtronic.  OmniPod also holds only 200 units, while the others hold 300.  There is quite a bit of insulin waste with Tandem so after filling the tubing and not being able to use around 20-25 units in the cartridge you have about 250-260 units you can actually use if you fill it completely.  That’s important only if you have higher insulin requirements.

So, you will see many recommendations for Tandem.  It’s a great pump, Dexcom is a great sensor and much easier to apply than Medtronic which requires putting tape over the whole thing after inserting.  Tandem is also smaller and sleeker and has a touch screen vs Medtronic’s chunky block of plastic and lots of button pressing."

Someone else mentioned Omnipod 5 as well, which is also closed loop. 

My advice is to do some homework. Read about the different pumps. Watch some YouTube reviews. The best ones are the ones that can tell you why the do or don’t like a particular pump, and then you can decide if that applies to you."

It’s going to happen. You are toughing it out. Taking care of yourself (taking a breather) is the grown up choice.

"Insulin needs increased dramatically while recovering, when will i be back to normal?","Hi all, i’ve been sick with what i’m thinking is the cold or flu for about a week. I’ve been slowly recovering on my own and have been doing much better and am able to get back to daily activities, exercise, and work. I’ve just had a nasty dry cough that won’t go away, but i’m sure that will take some time. 

I know being sick i need to increase my insulin, but this sickness has been absolutely brutal and it seems my needs increase more everyday. my basal insulin has increased by 70% and i have to give myself 5x more my normal bolus only to end up at the higher end of bgs after a meal. I’ve been eating smaller amount of carbs because i can’t deal with the highs, and for a normal 15g carb meal, which i normally give 1 unit now needs 5 units, plus 2-4 correction for the next couple of hours. 

it seems every day i get better i need more insulin. i feel like i’m fully recovered except for this dry cough so i’m wondering when this resistance, if that’s what it is, will go back to normal?

I’ve been eating smaller amount of carbs because i can’t deal with the highs, and for a normal 15g carb meal, which i normally give 1 unit now needs 5 units, plus 2-4 correction for the next couple of hours. 

it seems every day i get better i need more insulin. i feel like i’m fully recovered except for this dry cough so i’m wondering when this resistance, if that’s what it is, will go back to normal?

Edit: for a casual exercise profile/slow gradual incline I creating a basal profile at 50% and running it in sleep mode heads off the initial spike and the lower basal allows me to drift back to where I started. I had no issues on 2-4hr hikes with that.

But I tried it on a steeper hike and my BG was spiking harder/faster but when I hit the top of the first incline my legs started feeling like jello, I turned back before my bg crashed.  I might try that one with just the 50% profile and controliq off, or dialing my profile back to 25% and run in sleep mode(which should cap how much extra basal it gives during the initial spike). Normal controliq or exercise mode are problematic and deliver surges of insulin without reducing for activity level"

You still have to be cautious of heavy ketones(ketoacidosis is still possible and starvation can also trigger it, as well as missing or delaying any insulin), staying hydrated, and replacing electrolytes."

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high. 

I hate it all. I hate so much that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so tired, and so angry. And I can't do a goddamn thing because I'm stuck with this disease until the day I die.

Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high. 

I hate it all. I hate so much that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so tired, and so angry. And I can't do a goddamn thing because I'm stuck with this disease until the day I die. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ojnya/im_so_fucking_sick_of_this_and_pissed_as_hell/,"Oh man that sucks! 

I also had this issue with the cartridge needs at least 50 units. I think it happened because there were still air bubbles in the cartridge as I didn't remove them thoroughly enough. This is why the pump didn't understand how much insulin was in the cartridge and dismissed it completely. I agree that is an annoying process, I think it also comes only after filling the tube so doesn't make much sense. 

I hope you are okay. Diabetes is so fucking unforgiving and punishes the smallest mistakes.

Maybe you can make a checklist for traveling with your equipment and going to concerts to have everthing prepared. I know that it sucks but t sucks more to have panic because there is not all equipment in place. When I travel I take double as much as I need from everything to never land in a situation where I get stressed."
I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes.

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck.

The biggest thing I can recommend is just making sure you have something to fix a low (or the ability to get food/sugar from the venue).... correcting a high takes way too long so unless you're on the path to DKA just wait until the concert is over to correct. As far as alarms go... disable high alerts for dexcom before events (unless it's a loud concert) and you probably won't have to worry about the dreadful urgent low alarm.

You've got this, it just takes trial and error to figure out. You don't want to treat these events like any other day with diabetes"

I have an insulin bag.

I have major anxiety and use whatever bag, but make sure any time your travel away from home you bring it and you’ll always have an abundance of supplies. being a diabetic is hard and it is unfair and scary sometimes. that being said, the best you can do is come more prepared than you did the previous time until you have a good collection of what you need to feel secure and safe!

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me.

Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site.

I’m an mdi guy (woman) and usually concerts or events involves eating out which means a lot of carb count guessing. Usually all is well but there was the time at the Colbert show, I thought I was all set for a few hours as we planned to eat after the show but all that walking beforehand I started to drop like a stone. No in and out privileges in the waiting pen, sweating, panicking. The staff were nice enough to get me a banana.  I JUST made it through the show but was constantly glancing at my dex throughout and saying “hang in there”. Then at the Kennedy Center a couple of months ago, we ate beforehand, I estimated my insulin, and once again dropping like a stone just before curtain and having to rush out to concession to get a lemonade.

Exercise mode will give you boluses to knock down your BG, leaving you with a lot of insulin on board, which is bad. Sleep mode just tweaks the basal to bring you down.

I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick.

That's it. No pumps. No shots. No pricks. I'm in range 99% of the time and have an A1c of 5.3.  Not too shabby, right?  To be fair, I am LADA so I do have a bit residual beta cell activity. That's a crutch that might make things a bit easier for me than for others. But I can't prove that.

Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me.

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ??

I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high. 

I hate it all. I hate so much that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so tired, and so angry. And I can't do a goddamn thing because I'm stuck with this disease until the day I die.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ojnya/im_so_fucking_sick_of_this_and_pissed_as_hell/,"Diabetes gets in the way of so much. Sorry you went through that. My least favorite is being high all day and trying so hard to bring it down and nothing working. Then right before bed, I plummet. It sucks.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

I have the same pump and it’s absolutely ridiculous you can’t use a cartridge with less than 50 units. Even if you have 50+ units the tubing takes like 10-13 to fill, so really it’s more like you need 65-70 just to change cartridge. It’s a joke. 

One thing I’ve started using to fix lows recently is dried fruit. The Aldi in my area sells bags of them for $3-5. You can carry a decent amount of them in a small bag and they contain a good amount of sugar.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ojnya/im_so_fucking_sick_of_this_and_pissed_as_hell/,"I'm not trying to be that guy. But I do have to say that going to concerts is absolutely possible. I've done some actual crazy shit at 3 day long festivals. I remember being under the influence of MDMA, LSD, and Psilocybin at the same time and surviving just fine.  Been to 100s of shows. I also play music. That is usually more stressful though. Never in my life has diabetes prevented me from going. I went to the hardcore shit like burning man type festivals. Three days straight in the summer. 

It seems like you are being overwhelmed by the bullshit nagging way that diabetes can play on your psyche. You start to doubt yourself. You start to question if things are actually working. A lot of concerts involve being nervous until you are chilling out near the stage. This can actually cause pretty bad stress highs. In this case your pump site was probably fine. But the stress was making the insulin take that much longer. Learning how to deal with stress highs makes it much easier. For a bad site I typically rub my finger on the site and see if there is any insulin on it. Unless the site is fully blown out and leaking insulin I don't trip about it until I'm back in the car. I'll switch to taking MDI bolus shots if needed and using the site for basal. One thing is that when a site is blown sometimes it still works for basal. Still keeps you steady. Change it out as fast as possible of course. Just don't panic about it. 

Just always have backup plans. One time at Sierra Nevada World Music Festival I did actually have to go to the tent for a low sugar. Most these larger shows have a medical tent and EMTs available at all times. They ran me in there and treated the low. They were so kind about it too. I left with smiles and some backup granola bars."

I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ojnya/im_so_fucking_sick_of_this_and_pissed_as_hell/,"I feel ya!  I have been dropping low for some reason lately.  I've had Diabeters about 6 years now, so I don't think it's due to 'honeymooning.'  More likely it's a symptom of me finally becoming more in tune with my diet.  For me counting carbs and learning about foods is a process that turns into better habits. Eating right and getting the straight line graph at the end of the day is more rewarding than a slice of pie. 

One thing that I tried early on was the dexCGM.   It was expensive and not super easy to maintain so I went back to finger sticks.  Recently, my doc wanted me to go on dex AND a pump but I decided to stay more analog for a number of reasons but primarily:
 1. Wearing a pump and a CGM would be bad for me because I'm a notorious clutz, always bumping into stuff, I have a job with lots of physical activity. 
Also, managing 2 electronic devices seems like a chore when I can't even manage my laundry!
 2. I also wanted to stay attached to the process so I will instinctively KNOW what my dose should be considering the factors that are going to affect the results like activity, stress, food.   Kinda like, how I have memorized my close friends phone numbers, frequently I dial them up when calling rather than scrolling through my contacts. (If you've ever been to county, you know how important it is to have a few numbers LOL.)

Now I am using the libre 3, and a inpen to log my doses and have a record of the results.  It is working really good for me.  
I've never tried a pump, it seems to work for some people but to me it seems like a whole lot more work and the added stress of not being in control.       

I used to think drinking would be the death of me but now it's the goddamn swedish fish, or NOT having a swedish fish at those times when I desperately need one.  
For concerts I treat it as a normal day, but then throw a hamburger on top for dancing, and some mushrooms to enjoy the show :) - I'll worry about getting my GL's back the next day!"

There are no days off, and the slightest mistake can send you spiraling for hours and hours. I've. had many days like the one you describe and it just is not fair.

You probably don't want advice right now, but just two things: I'm on a Tandem pump but I get a prescription for pens as well and whenever I travel more than an hour from home I bring the pen insulin with me (as well as all the backup pump supplies) in case the pump fails me so I can just switch back to shots. I also always bring 2-3 times as many snacks as I think I'll need, and I bring a mix of fast acting sugar like smarties and glucose tabs, and slower acting like granola bars or peanut butter crackers. The trouble with just relying on glucose tabs is that they'll pop you up quick but won't necessarily keep you there; you need something with more substance to keep you up.

And yes, it sucks having to carry all this extra shit around with me. I feel paranoid, and like I'm old before my time always traveling with all this stuff and checking and double checking to make sure I have all my supplies on me. But the crappy thing about diabetes is we don't get any room for error - any small mistake, or even not a mistake! and we end up in a medical emergency situation quickly.

I hope you can do something nice and relaxing for yourself to enjoy the rest of your weekend and give your body a break after all this stress. After I have a really bad diabetes day I try to treat myself to something small - seeing a movie, or buying myself something, or just spending a day on the couch watching my favorite show - to be kind to myself."

I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high. 

I hate it all. I hate so much that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so tired, and so angry. And I can't do a goddamn thing because I'm stuck with this disease until the day I die. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ojnya/im_so_fucking_sick_of_this_and_pissed_as_hell/,This is why I got off the pump. That and losing my health insurance. The pump fucked me over so many times by not administering the insulin properly that I just said fuck it and went back on injections and I’m in better control because of that.
I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high. 

I hate it all. I hate so much that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so tired, and so angry. And I can't do a goddamn thing because I'm stuck with this disease until the day I die.

I don’t have a pump I use pens but I’ve been considering a pump but this whole thing you described kinda stresses me out about pumps. Earlier today my blood sugar was high like around 250 and it put me in an annoyed mood and my mother kept asking about my blood sugar every 5 minutes and I snapped at her earlier. It’s the frustration it grows and grows. I hate this damn disease too, it just plain sucks"
I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed.

how prepared you are and it’s not you’re fault. one thing i’ve learned over the years for vacations is to bring a vial of humalog and a vial of lantus + syringes vs the pre filled cartridges (or in addition!) because it gives you much more wiggle room for your pumps weird specifications for site changes. you can buy cold packs specifically for storing insulin that you stick in the freezer before hand and will keep the insulin cold even if it’s not refrigerated. i’m pretty sure the brand i have is called Frio. best of luck to you"

I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high. 

I hate it all. I hate so much that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so tired, and so angry. And I can't do a goddamn thing because I'm stuck with this disease until the day I die.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise?

I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out.

Mine is an OmniPod and the activity mode reduces basal delivery and sets my target glucose at 150mg/dL while exercising. It only gives me insulin if I need it to stay in the 150mg/dL range. This happens if I’ve eaten too much sugar before or during exercise (like a glucose gel of some sort or other). I have been able to safely train and run marathons due to my activity mode.

Again, that’s just my system and my settings. Everyone should consult their educator and/or endo to learn how activity/exercise mode works for their goals. Stay strong everyone! 💙"

Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher.

But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise? 

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high.

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping.

Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used.

So now I'm sitting here, stressed out because if I have another super high blood sugar episode that includes a lot of bolusing I'll find myself on limited insulin for the rest of this trip. I'm pissed that I had to put in a whole new cartridge when there was plenty left. And I can't just take it all out to put in a new one because I'm on a trip without all my supplies. I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high. 

I hate it all. I hate so much that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so tired, and so angry. And I can't do a goddamn thing because I'm stuck with this disease until the day I die. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ojnya/im_so_fucking_sick_of_this_and_pissed_as_hell/,"I agree. Ever since starting the Omnipod 5, my blood sugar has never been better and I feel better too. I haven't woken up 250+ since using it. I now wake up and I'm around 130. But, I can understand using a pump can be frustrating too. I've had issues with failed pods, but I still feel the benefits of the Omnipod 5 outweigh the issues I've had so far. I specifically went with Omnipod 5 because of its ease of use and it being tubeless. I hope to never go back to MDI. But, of course everyone is different and you got to do what works for you."
I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough.

Without a controlled study we really can't know for sure how far off my or your take is on the reality of zero beta cell T1ds using my regimen.  

What I can say is that I think a low-carb diet seems to more or less ensure a relatively spike-free life, which leads to far less insulin extremes, which in turn leads to less lows, etc.

Overall, after 3 years of experience with Afrezza, I remain unconvinced that one would have *more* control with traditional insulin tbh - the rapid in/rapid out dynamics would seem to enhance one's ability to control glucose levels to a very fine level. In terms of the dosing, it's apples and oranges to injections so I would suggest that it's difficult to know for sure unless you tried it to see if you still feel the lack of dosing options is a real or perceived issue.

To answer your question, I do not yet give myself a basal injection, which leads to me using Afrezza basically all day long.  Soon, weekly basal will be approved by the FDA which I will probably jump on given its effects are shown to be similar in clinical trials and only require a weekly injection."

I might try to do a few boluses with a syringe from that cartridge so it doesn't go to waste but either way I'm pissed. And I can't go to concerts anymore, because twice now I've had diabetes related issues at them. One let to a full on panic attack, crying and shaking and genuinely believing I was going to die. The other I came very close to a panic attack and was extremely anxious for several hours, and had to miss a decent amount of the concert because of it. I still have tickets to a concert in September, and I don't even want to go anymore. I don't want to have to deal with this shit. It's 3am and I'm so tired but I'm still over 400 so I can't go to sleep. 

I was already burnt out. Already sick of getting woken up in the middle of the night because occasionally I lay on my dexcom on accident and occasionally that makes it think I'm super low so it beeps, and there's no way to turn those fucking alarms off. I'm sick of every time my pump tubing catches on something and it fucking hurts. I'm sick of constantly having to think about blood sugars any time I try to go anywhere or do anything and figure out how to bring the supplies I need and check my dexcom every couple minutes to make sure I'm not about to be low or super high. 

I hate it all. I hate so much that there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so tired, and so angry. And I can't do a goddamn thing because I'm stuck with this disease until the day I die.

I'm so fucking sick of this. And pissed as hell that my day was ruined. And that concerts have been ruined for me. Fuck you diabetes.,"Apologies in advance, this is just going to be a fairly long rant about my day and how much I feel diabetes ruins everything, but I'm just really tired and really angry right now and don't know what else to do about it because I can't sleep due to, you guessed it, diabetes. 

Words can't describe what a shitty day it has been and how fucking sick of it all I am. I've already been feeling extremely burnt out for a long time, and after such a long day of the utter nightmare this disease is I wish more than anything I could just fucking quit. Diabetes has ruined one of my favorite things, which is going to concerts. And my entire night. And fuck this shitty tandem pump. And I'm so fucking done with it. 

Two months ago, I went to a concert. Brought a tube of glucose tabs as well as some extra smarties packs, as I usually do. Kept my pump on exercise mode so I'd hopefully stay a little higher. Still, my blood sugar dropped. No problem, eat a few tabs. Still dropping. I ended up having to eat everything I had with me, and then had a panic attack because I was in a GA only concert near to the front, and if I still dropped I'd be out of luck. Luckily it worked out, but I had a miserable time due to the stress. 

Then we get to today. Went to a concert with an extra site, glucose tabs, smarties, the usual. Get there, and realize I'm going really high. Try bolusing. Does nothing. Try putting in the new site. Realize I don't think it went in correctly, but couldn't tell for sure. Spoiler, it didn't. Ended up having to miss most of the openers (who were bands I actually enjoyed) to go to first aid where I could get a syringe, and completely guess on giving myself insulin because it was a different kind of syringe with different measurements? and I didn't know if my pump had been delivering to me, and obviously didn't want a repeat of the low situation. Yes, it was fucking stupid of me to not be carrying a syringe. I do most of the time, but I'd forgotten to put one in my purse after the one I used to have in it got taken out whenever it got used. So a stupid mistake, but it ruined the entire concert I spent a couple hundred dollars in tickets on because I spent the entire time super high, miserable, had to go to the bathroom multiple times, and was extremely stressed about getting sick. And I'm mad that other people don't have to worry about forgetting things like this and having everything be ruined.

After two hours of trying to get out of the parking lot and then get through the traffic to get to my hotel (which was horrendous for no apparent reason), I've been in the high 300s/over 400s range for several hours. I get to the hotel, get a new site, put it in. I try to go to fill the canula or whatever its called. After its done (and I don't know if maybe in exhaustion I somehow hit fill tubing or something), I get an alert that the cartridge has to have at least 50 units in it ?? I thought I'd had about 60 or something, but I guess not. I'm out of town for the concert, all the way until Thursday. I had brought two pre-filled cartridges with me, planning to change them Monday and Thursday. Theoretically, more than enough. But now, even though that cartridge still had enough insulin in it to get me through the night and some of tomorrow, I have to change it out. Because tandem is fucking stupid and either doesn't like me having to do a site change (correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've always been told with a new site you fill canula again) or I guess I'm the fucking idiot who clicked a wrong button in pure exhaustion and the pump wouldn't let me backtrack. I know I originally filled canula, I'm wondering though if after accepting it I hit fill tubing? Because why the fuck would it make me have 50 units otherwise?

But forgive my ignorance, lancets cost me like $10 for 2-3months supply. Re-pricking yourself with the same needle that is re-exposed to the elements everytime you reuse it can put you at risk (very unlikely) for some pretty gnarly infections. I get that it’s a joke but do people actually use the same lancet 10+ times???? I’m about a year into being a type 1. 

Sometimes when I ask for a box of pen needles at the pharmacy they open the box and ask me how many I’m looking for?? I say the whole box (100) and they question how often i swap out needles???  I said everytime and they seemed to judge me for it. Very confusing, when I asked my endo about it he highly recommended I continue my practise but he has patients that leave needles in their pens for multiple uses? Is that common? 

I’m so lost, again please forgive my ignorance, I’m very lucky to have insurance that covers most of my T1 needs. And I understand that’s not the case for all. But given how expensive insulin is, needles, wipes & lancets are next to nothing."

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ow288/t1d_parent_is_cgm_and_pump_absolutely_necessary/,"Slightly different take- its not about getting your kid under good (or better) control with the CGM- its about the utter lack of control with school IMO.  Schedules in school are wild and can and will change without much communication to parents.   Extra recess bc its beautiful out, double up on PE bc the art teacher is out sick, not to mention recess is typically after lunch (and thus activates the kids insulin extra hard.). At 5- your child may or may not be able to communicate his schedule to you and why he dropped- but also hypoglycemia can come on FAST.  The nurse might mean well and think she’s comfortable- but in my experience with my kid- the school system has only ever had superficial knowledge of Type 1.  Also- schools have SOOO much extra food for all sorts of nonsense reasons and its nice to be able to have the kid (or teacher) shoot a text asking if its ok to eat xyz today and see the glucose and trend and ok (or deny) so they arent always left out (or having to delay and go to office etc).  

The pump decision can take or leave when (or if) your kid and you decide he’s ready….its really independent of the CGM.  But I truly think the CGM is crucial to safety at school with the lack of set scheduling we have experienced."

 With the CGM I really would recommend to just try it out. It is pretty much the best thing you can have as t1diabetic and if you have the option, persuade your son to give it a try. It really doesn't hurt. Alternatively the Libre sensor is even a bit easier to handle in my opinion and if you do not necessary want a certain pump also the Libre sensor should be considered.

When it comes to the pump I made the switch after many years on MDI. I didn't want a pump for a long time for various reasons. I also managed well with MDI. I wouldn't want to live without my pump anymore, but if I had to give away my CGM it would be worse."

Like many, I lived for years without a CGM but I’d rather live without a car than lose my CGM. It’s super helpful. 

Pumps are just preference. I manage with MDI and will for the rest of my life. Like your son, I hate having something attached to me. But a cgm is worth it.

Nothing will control DM1 better than a CGM and pump closed loop system. NOTHING. That’s literally why the technology was developed and evolved from older pumps and meter systems.

What is the advantage of learning “to manage diabetes manually” if it doesn’t provide the optimal glucose control? Why would anybody do that? MDIs can’t provide optimal control for most people and are so much riskier/prone to mis-dosing and triggering extreme highs and lows. They also keep young diabetics much more needy and dependent on others to manage their TID instead of encouraging and empowering them to manage their own glucose control early on.

EVERYBODY is scared to get on a CGM and on a pump. A 45 yo man is just as afraid of starting those therapies as a 5 yo boy with sensory issues is. It’s never going to NOT be scary to start these therapies. But they are godsends. Nothing nothing nothing controls bg better.

CGMs and pumps are the gold standard of TID management in 2023. What is the advantage of not having the best technology and the best bg control?"

A CGM and a pump are not necessary by definition. However, having been using a CGM for the last four years, I can honestly say life without it sucked. I’ve got so much more insight into my sugars now not the least of which is the ability to know not only if my blood sugar is 100 but in my head it up or down and what has the trend been. The trending in and of itself was huge for me because it eliminated overnight lows that once or twice resulted in an ambulance.

Bottom line, I’d strongly recommend you get him to TRY a Libre 3 if he has a smartphone (probably not at his age). If not Libre 3, try Libre 2 with a reader. Those are the two smallest and least intrusive devices. Even if he won’t scan it with the reader, it will hold data for eight hours, so every scan will provide you at least the last eight hours of data. The trending will be invaluable."

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ow288/t1d_parent_is_cgm_and_pump_absolutely_necessary/,"Yes, you can manage diabetes without a cgm and pump, but there are NO advantages to doing so. A cgm gives you so much information you can NEVER get, even using finger sticks 12+ times a day. You can see patterns and trends, tell if the blood sugar is moving up or down, and get alerts to notify you before problems happen. As a parent you can also use the follow app (your child needs a phone - it's worth it though) to be able to get alerts while you sleep, when at work, or just peek in to see how your kid is doing. A cgm will help your child be the healthiest possible, letting you see what specific meals do to his sugars. It will also give you peace of mind, letting you get a full night's sleep (my mom raised 2 of us T1s before cgms existed and was up most nights checking blood sugars), giving your son freedom to sleep over at a friend's or play at the park without you needing to hover. A cgm is 100% worth any hassle, and even if it bothers your son at first, he will get used to it. Finger sticks are painful, cause damage to the fingertips (eventually reducing sensation), and provide minimal information. There is ZERO advantage to doing this 'manually'. Occasionally, doing a finger stick to check the accuracy of the cgm or when something feels 'off' is one thing - using this method by choice is not advisable. There are a handful of people that don't get accurate results from a cgm, but even for them it is typically advantageous to use one (this is typically related to medications they take, being chronically dehydrated, or having zero body fat, and is a very small percentage of people). 

My little brother was diagnosed at 3, about a decade before the first cgm even existed. Yes, we managed OK on finger sticks and mdi (he got his first pump at 7), but it meant that when he asked for seconds of dinner or a cookie in the afternoon my mom would have to remind him it would mean an extra injection. We drew 1/2 units, skinny units, and fat units (lining the edge of the plunger up with the edge of the line marking units), all on syringes with 1 unit markings (1/2 unit marked syringes were not available) to try to control his sugars. For a little person, a 1/2 unit is huge!! A pump gives the wearer so much freedom. You can eat what you want when you want without injections. This is huge for a growing child whose appetite can vary greatly from one day to the next. You can also do extended bolusing for pizza, ice cream, and other challenging foods - making them much easier. A pump means a much more normal life with a lot fewer nos. More than that, though, it means better control. With proper setup, you can have a profile for field day, sick days, sunny days (my mom could always tell what the weather was from my brother's blood sugars - the sun shining made such a difference even without activity changes), soccer games, etc. This makes control much easier. You can also set basal rates to deal with dawn phenomenon and other hormonal issues. There are so many things that go into T1 management, but the pump (especially if you get a hybrid loop) simplifies so much. 

I understand the idea that you want your son to learn to do things manually. What if the tech fails, etc. To this, I would say that learning now how to manage manually isn't really helpful for a future issue. I spent over 20 years on mdi and finger sticks. I am still lost without the data from my cgm. I dose more on trend arrows than I do on current sugar, and I can't get this info using finger sticks. Yes, I can keep myself alive (sort of, I am hypoglycemic, unaware, so the alarms on dexcom are literally a life saver), but old experience wasn't an advantage for this at all. I have also had a couple of pump failures in the last 10 years. Both times, I had to go on mdi for 1-3 days to get a replacement pump. In theory, I knew how to convert my basal to long-acting insulin and switch to bolus for short acting, but it's not like you just pick up your old insulin dosing and go on fine. Control is much more fine-tuned with a pump, and mdi can never easily replace it. It's a new learning curve every switch. If even 20 years of mdi doesn't prepare you for a tech failure, what difference does learning to do it manually before switching make?


The areas I do think it is important to at least understand how to do things manually are in calculating insulin dose (my blood sugar is 200 and my target is 100, I have a correction factor of 1:35, how much insulin do I need or I want to eat 52 carbs and my carb ratio is 1:10, how much insulin do I need). These are the skills it will take your son time to learn, and some can never manage complex numbers (my carb ratio is 1:17 or 1:18 depending on time of day. I have a math minor, but even I used simpler numbers when doing things manually and calculated 1:15 or 1:20 - mental math gets complicated and prone to error). Teaching your son to estimate his insulin dose and comparing it to the calculated pump dose will both teach him how to do the math and serve as a double check - you are less likely to give 20 units of insulin instead of entering 20 grams of carb (just over 1 unit in my case), if you always compare the amount being delivered with the amount you expect. The math is the only manual skill I personally believe has an advantage in today's world. If tech fails, your doctor can tell you how to deal with it (most insurance companies have 24-hour advice with a doctor on call), but if you don't understand the math it can be a real challenge. The advantage of using a pump sooner is that it can help keep your child safe from errors in the math while they are learning, and minimizes the risks of accidentally overdosing (its still possible, but the cgm will alert you and you have a history on the pump so you can figure out exactly what happened). 

To mention one other thing, you said the nurse is on board with manually doing blood sugars and injections at school. Have you talked about what happens when she is sick? It's easy to have teachers, the principal, or other adults at the school help ensure that the blood sugar and carb amount are correct and deliver insulin on a pump (and many children can start doing this on their own with supervision pretty young - pumps also can have lock functions to prevent the kid from deciding to dose on their own), but it is much more challenging to find someone willing and able to give an injection (and this requires certification in many states). Are you planning on trying to use an insulin like NPH to avoid injections at school? Or are you going to the school every day to give your son insulin for lunch?"

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ow288/t1d_parent_is_cgm_and_pump_absolutely_necessary/,"I'm a huge pump proponent.  I've been on one for 15 years(T1 for 37) and I have no intentions to ever go back to MDI.  But I also say that it's up to the individual to make their own mind up, because they are the one that has to wear it 24/7.  As far as the CGM goes, and I don't have sensory issues, but usually after it's on, you usually forget it's there.

So, while I'd never willingly give up my pump and/or CGM, I'll say that it's not 100% necessary to have one or either.  Neither of these things existed, at least in the practical mainstream sense that they do today, back when I was diagnosed.  And I, and millions of others made it through.  I went \~22 years doing MDI.  And then an additional seven before I got a CGM(would have been sooner, but it took forever before the Animas Vibe, which was the first pump with integrated CGM/Dexcom display capability was approved by the FDA here in the US)."

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ow288/t1d_parent_is_cgm_and_pump_absolutely_necessary/,"I spent the first 11 years of my diabetes old school with just finger pricks and shots. So it is not necessary. But I will say that after I switched to a CGM and pump, my A1c's went from the 8's to the 6's. my health today is so, so much better.

I think the pump is  debatable - it definitely has its pros and cons - but I would recommend **every** diabetic get a CGM. You can pry my CGM out of my cold, dead, hands. It gives me so much more peace of mind and security, and so much better information. Without it I feel like I'm fumbling around in the dark. I would highly, highly recommend it. I really can't overstate that.

On the pump: overall I'm glad I have it and plan to stick with it. The new pumps and integrate with the CGMs, like Tandem's Control IQ is so amazing. It is really the cutting edge. I finally feel like I have someone else helping me manage my diabetes, and its not all on me.  It is really the next step forward in diabetes care. 

Having a pump also makes managing my diabetes easier in my day to day life. In the old days I'd have to leave class to go to the bathroom to give myself shots. And you can only do that so many times. I ended up missing out on a lot of things in my life, and delaying giving a lot of needed shots, because of this. With the pump, the other day I was running late to a work meeting, and as I hurried to get there when I got into the elevator, I looked at my CGM, saw I was high, and gave myself insulin - all from my phone which talks to my pump! It took five seconds. In the old days I'd have to either (1) be late to my meeting and risk impacting my career, or (2) run high for hours until I could find time for a shot. This happens many times a day, and blousing from the pump is just so much more convenient. 

On the downside with the pump thought, I have a lot of anxiety about pump site failure. I have had several instances where I inserted the pump site wrong and I figure it out after several hours of being high and feeling sick and have to change the site. Once it happened and I was so freaked out about ketones I went to the ER to get help. I probably didn't need to go, but I was throwing up at that point. So there are definitely pros and cons with the pump. It is not a perfect technology, and there is a learning curve and there is work required on my part to utilize it correctly. But all in all I think my life is better with the pump.

But CGM's, no question. Everyone should get one. 

Good luck!

I had little issues with it compared to the many issues I had with needles. I also really liked my freestyle libre, the dexcom not as much but they might be better now. If he is good at taking care of himself with finger pricks and needles then do what’s best for him! My main advice would be to send him with LOTS of extra supplies if you don’t already and also if he doesn’t know how to advocate for himself and his health give him lots of tips on how to do so. Also more fun advice, look into diabetes summer camps for the future! I have a great support system and got lots of good education from the one I went to, let me know if you want my recommendation. That’s probably been the best thing for me since T1 kids are more prone to feelings of Isolation due to feeling different or alone In their experiences. Good luck!"

You should do what you feel comfortable with - if you feel you don't \_need\_ a CGM or a pump, there are people who have gotten by with no CGM for years.

What kind of A1C are you seeing with your son? What kind of insulin are you using for fast acting / long acting?

You said your son has sensory issues - I have to think you do multiple fingersticks per day, any reason to think a GCM will be a bigger burden than finger sticks?

There are pros and cons to pumps / CGMs / and closed loop systems. It's certainly possible to get great numbers without a CGM and using MDI, I think most people find the mental effort too high and / or can't keep their a1c within the ADA guidelines which is now less than 7.0 for kids and adults.

If you have an a1c around 7 using MDI and you prefer that system to pumps /  CGMs, then you do you.

OTOH, if your sons a1c is much higher than 7, I think you should think about how to incorporate tech into your routine."

I’m a caretaker of a T1D child. My niece. She got her first pump at age 4. She was on a pump that no longer exists anymore and it was tubed. The tubing terrified her more than anything because she was terrified it’d get caught on things and be pulled out. It’s a legit fear for kids going to school. So we also thought about just doing shots. 

The big deciding factor for us was that her school did not have a full time nurse or even plans to hire a full time nurse. So for Kindergarten we decided on the dexcom and omnipod set up. 

Sensory issues is certainly a big factor. Totally get that. When talking to your endo about pumps, they often let you put one on to see how it feels and what its like before its actually in use. Thats how we started on the omnipod. My niece wore a pod with water in it for 3 days and told us how she felt with it on. It may be worth to ask your little guy if he would like to wear one for a few days or a few hours just to see what he experiences. 

Removal also doesnt have to be hard. Most people soak the adhesive with unisolv and it comes right off like a bandaid. 

But do what’s best for you. Maybe an education session where your little guy can play around with the devices and touch them. But if he is still okay with MDI, then let it be. If he is interested in devices, take his lead and explore."
T1D parent. Is CGM and pump absolutely necessary?,"My son was diagnosed when he was 2. He’s 5 now and about to start elementary school this fall. His endo keeps pressuring me to force him to wear a Dexcom so he can eventually get an insulin pump. My son has sensory issues and is really scared of getting the Dexcom. I also want him to learn to manage his diabetes manually before even thinking about using any technology. The nurse at his school says she’s comfortable with doing everything manually and we live super close to school in case I need to go help. I don’t work so I’ll be available while he’s at school. We’ve been managing his blood sugar just fine so far without it. So, question is, is there anyone who has managed their T1D long-term without a cgm or pump? Or is it absolutely necessary to use these things? 

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ow288/t1d_parent_is_cgm_and_pump_absolutely_necessary/,"Yes, I’ve managed without the tech for many years and my a1c is in the 6-7 range, the best it’s ever been. I have skin allergies and get very irritated by adhesives but if I could use a CGM i absolutely would. In fact, my endo just ordered me the dexcom G7 to try because it’s supposed to be a bit easier on the skin and I’m very excited to give it another go! Managing without a CGM is doable but it is hard and I am an adult with t1d for 20 years. For someone his age I think, If he can get used to wearing one, it will make life so much easier for him and everyone else involved in his management. It’s definitely worth a try!"

As a teenager who used both MDI and a pump going through puberty, I will say that having the ability to change basal insulin for different times of day and constantly changing it due to hormones that come with the territory is really useful.

But for now, don’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do."

mdi and no cgm might produce good results for adults with fully developed frontal lobes and self awareness of low/high symptoms, but kiddos entering school and wanting to eat/do everything their friends are doing + educators that may or may not be watching for red flag symptoms may need a little more interference health wise- just my opinion as a former kid"

It absolutely does make a difference in being able to control your diabetes. I'm not even sure if it was available to me when I was first diagnosed, but once my endos have been asking me about it I was hesitant to it because I didn't want to give the robots an easy way to kill me once Skynet goes live. Anyways Jokes Aside, it really does give you a lot more control than not being on the pump or CGM. Plus as a parent it can help you more easily know when your kid is having a low. Lows can be deadly, especially if it's a late night low. In the past I think they would rather a kid stay slightly high than to risk a low, but that's at the disadvantage of causing health problems later on in life. With a pump, you may be able to have tighter control to reduce some of the complications later on. Especially with a kid. Also, when they go into their teenage years it's going to be even harder to manage their blood sugar. A pump will give you an easier way of control. You can address your basal insulin throughout the day, you can have different boluses based off of the type of food that you eat and the time of day that you're eating, a pump can also address how much insulin it's giving you based off of how much insulin you already have in your system. I would really recommend it if you could."

My older brother who is also T1D since he was 4, and didn't get a CGM until he was 34 has had some long term complications that could have been avoided if he had a CGM earlier.

Sometimes at outdoor time I would notice him getting pale and sweaty and would call him over. We would sit on the stairs and I would ask how he was feeling.  He was usually ""fine"". I would point out what I saw and suggest we do a poke.  He was usually low.  I was trying to teach him and model to him to mind the signs.  The other teachers started asking what I was doing...because they too thought he was fine.  They didn't get it, they didn't live it.  They did start noticing some of the same signs I did.  But you really cannot rely on a 5-year-old to notice all the time as he is dropping. Nor can you count on the staff to notice the subtle changes and catch it while it's not an emergency.

To this day nearly forty years later I’ve refused pumps, but for me, CGM enforced really good habits, but I wouldn’t subject a five year old nor ten year old to it. 

To keep much of my same anonymity what I’ve done is put phone on silent, and shut alarms off. I’ve got an Apple Watch that always displays my reading, and how much it changed in five minutes. I also use a program used endobits to give me a thirty minute warning things are awry… I need a bit of food, exercise, or a few units of insulin. When that rumbles my wrist, time to act. It’s all really good, but at the same time anxiety causing when rumbles are non-stop and you have something else to try and focus on. I needed six months to really adjust to those warnings and changing my habits. It’s a bigger life alteration than injections and testing for me.  At some point, maybe 15 or so, likely a good time to have such a system to enforce proper habits…. It gets real slippy when you don’t test, don’t make time to handle things and worry more about hanging out/drinking with friends. Until then?  Have fast acting sugar always. Keep a pen in a Frio.

I also have sensory issues and found the libre worse than dexcom. Don't get me wrong I'm aware it's there and it can get itchy but the patch matters to me. You can get different types of patches so no issues. The adhesive sticker is a plaster like material.

I would suggest a cgm especially with school as we all know when kids get engrossed with their friends they ignore their basic needs at times so an alarm would help massively with lows especially if he hasn't fully learnt to feel them and you can't always feel them.

As for manually managing it you absolutely can but I regularly babysit a 5y/o boy who does understand my diabetes but I would air on the side of caution in teaching a child of that age manual management with a glucose meter with the view to him doing it himself. 

Also a cgm doesn't take away the need for finger pricking at all so he will still learn without the risk to him of ignoring low symptoms coz he's having fun at school.

And you can see his sugars at home even when he's at school to ease your own anxiety.

While the idea of having him learn all the complexities of doing everything manually, he’s not going to be old enough to manage his own diabetes until his teens or later. At that point, puberty and all the physical changes of becoming a teen are going to make his blood sugars really unpredictable, so the CGM is a really good tool for seeing what works best. Sensory wise, putting it on the back of his arm or butt might work best- I truly find I do not notice my dexcom if I can’t really see it. Obviously both pump and CGM are optional but the fact is that the CGM is a game changer and is nice because 1 poke replaces the 8+ finger sticks every day. And also it can alert you that he might be going low before he potentially has a low at school and not with the school nurse. But also trying out a CGM doesn’t mean you suddenly HAVE to keep using it, you could try it for a couple of months and if it doesn’t work switch back.

Your son will learn so much more about his diabetes from using a CGM than he will ever learn from finger sticks and the pump is the same because you try to mimic a working pancreas so much more closely with it than with injections.  Obviously, you don't do this at first and you can run a pump in a less ""intensive"" way until he's ready for more but, aside from learning to inject, which takes no time, there's nothing more that he'll learn from taking the manual route.

Edit: I have had T1D for 32v years and managed it with inductions for the first 12-13 years. While I've used CGM for short periods over the past 4-5 years, I've only been using it consistently for the past 13 months."

T1 for 37 years.  MDI \~22, Pump \~15, CGM \~8.  If I could only have one: a pump or CGM, I don't even have to think about it for one micro-second.  Pump wins hands down in a landslide, 1,000,000 : 1.  The convenience and flexibility that it provides cannot adequately be put into words.

Honestly, and my reasoning is flawed and unsound from a medical perspective, I would not want a CGM without a pump, because when you look and see that you're out of range and need a correction, you're going to have to take an additional shot.  On a pump, it can do it automatically(if you're looping) or you just grab your pump or phone and tap in the correction."

My recommendation would be to go online to etsy or Amazon and find stickers for the dexcom transmitter. They also make fun over patches. Let your son pick a pack he likes and make putting on dexcom a fun expression of his personality. Don't let him see your anxiety and just talk about the positives. Show him the graphs and tell him this is what is going on inside his body, let him eat a food that you find challenging and usually avoid so you can both see what happens. Try to make it a fun adventure so that he doesn't focus on the sensation. Remind him that he doesn't need to take as many finger sticks when wearing this (especially if he complains about them normally) if he is irritated by the dexcom. If you can get him to last a full session (10 days), you will probably be fine. If your son tends to have any allergies to bandaids, lotions, etc, use Flonase before the first application (you don't want an allergic reaction to make this process more challenging). Your doctor may be able to give you the first sensor for free, especially if you are looking at the dexcom g7 since it is 100% disposable. Even if not, as long as you have good insurance, you shouldn't be out much if your son really can't handle it, but I think you will be surprised. Dexcom is typically pretty painless, though the insertion sound is a bit starting on the on the g6 (I haven't tried the g7 yet). You might be best off trying the back of the hip first, where your son won't see it as much - though if he really likes the stickers and wants to show it off the arm can be good. You could also try to find a kid friendly robot movie and tell him he can be a cyborg (robot technology integrated into human flesh). I don't know your kid, but there are lots of ways to encourage little boys to do something they don't want to do given the right approach! 

Good luck :) 

Here's one option for dexcom stickers. There are tons of possibilities, or it's possible to even create your own (best if you have a Crikut or similar product):

School is unpredictable and even if your son’s teacher and all other staff are supportive of his needs and willing to learn what it takes to manage T1D (not all are!), you will be much less stressed out about his blood sugar and the risk of unexpected lows/highs (and you can proactively get ahead of BG issues by knowing from afar what his BG is). And, almost as importantly, checking BG levels from the classroom on a phone/receiver is far less disruptive to his learning routine than going to the nurse for finger sticks before snack, before and after recess, before lunch, after PE, etc. Our now 9 year old T1D absolutely despises the occasional days when he has Dexcom issues and must go back to the “old” way of finger sticks at the nurse.

The pump is less critical at your son’s age if his school has a nurse who is willing to deliver insulin via pen/syringe, but eventually a pump will allow your son significantly more freedom at school. Our 9 year old can basically manage his insulin delivery with only a quick check from his teacher. This has, again, significantly reduced the disruption in his schedule. He is away from the classroom much less with the pump than when he was MDI.

(Edit to add: even if well controlled on MDI without CGM, I bet you’ll see improvement when your son is on one or both CGM and pump. But that’s not the reason to add either of them for school IMO)"

T1D parent. Is CGM and pump absolutely necessary?,"My son was diagnosed when he was 2. He’s 5 now and about to start elementary school this fall.

There is no benefit to the “old school way” when it comes to the particular function of a CGM. Getting 8-10 snapshots of your blood sugar each day is nowhere near as informative or empowering as knowing what your blood sugar is all of the time and beyond that, if it is moving and how quickly. It also helps you understand how specific food choices impact your blood sugar in a way that the old school methods never could.

He’s scared of attaching this thing to his body and I get that. But realistically, it’s painless to insert and you don’t even notice it once it’s there. Yes, you should make him try it out for a ten day Dexcom session and during that time, point out how much more freedom the knowledge it provides gives back to him. Did you try telling him he doesn’t have to prick his finger anymore if he wears it? I assume that would be persuasive to a young child."

I’m not advocating that at all. But I encourage you to use your motherly influence and persuasive powers to steer him toward being open to the Dexcom, to just trying it. He’s never going to *want* it because nobody ever does. There’s something viscerally repelling about having a device of any sort on your body, whether it’s a CGM or a pacemaker or a hearing aid or dental braces. But wouldn’t he like to stop multiple finger sticks every day? Wouldn’t he like not having to test daily anymore? There are certainly advantages that would appeal to him that you could frame positively and encouragingly when discussing it with him. And OMG the advantages for you are so huge! Wouldn’t you like to be able to see his bg 24/7? Wouldn’t you like to have some warning when he’s about to crash or skyrocket? Isn’t the goal to make his TID as manageable and controlled as possible rather than to accommodate his reflexive wishes? I strongly encourage you to start planting the seeds that steer him toward the CGM. It’s probably just a matter of time anyway. Good luck!"

I would try to explain that it's not bad at all. I never notice mine. Even if I have ""bleeders"" they never hurt. A CGM offers so much freedom.

First of all, if you have a pump don’t use it, as far as I know dexcom is still the go to. But I am located in the chicago area and at least there through my doctor they offer the insertion through their office so I just go in for a normal check in and the insertion is about 15 minutes of just local numbing. I have heard that other places it’s a bit harder to find somewhere to insert it. The way it works is the sensor is in your skin and the transmitter is on your arm with a very nice adhesive that you can take off at any time. The transmitter needs to be charged like once a day(15 min max) and when it is off you get no readings to your phone. The system requires calibrations, 2 daily to start and then once a day after about a month, but it’s pretty picky so it will switch back to twice a day a lot. Overall I have found that the system is way more accurate then either the libre or the dexcom. For removal it’s the same thing of go in they remove it from one and put a new one in the other arm, I am just doing it when I go and meet with my doctor again. This is also my first Eversense so they offer a reduced pricing plan for the first one, and their customer service is very good for everything that I have done. Worst part is if you don’t time the calibrations right, you need to not of eaten or have insulin, it can be very annoying. But I love the freedom of taking it off to go swim for example, or being able to almost always trust the values that it gives. If you have any other questions feel free to ask I hope this helped."

First off 20 units for each meal is a lot. You need to try seeing a doctor to get your dosing right. Are you on long acting insulin? If you maintain having your a1c at 10 you are guaranteed to run into health complications later in your life. Like blindness and neuropathy, kidney failure and so on. 

If you are unable to see a doctor this is what you need to do. Get ready to eat a meal and find out how many carbs are in that meal. Take your normal 20 unit dose and check what your blood sugar is exactly 4 hours after you take your insulin. 

If your sugar is greater than 180 then take an extra unit for that same meal for every 50 points above 180. Then you will do the same thing over and over until you land in the 100-180 range 4 hours after eating a meal. I hope this helps let me know if you have more questions"

They have definitely not been turned into T1 diabetics. The main difference I see in these situations is that they use a massively larger amount of insulin than T1 patients because insulin resistance is a key feature of T2 diabetes. People with T2 often will still have a positive C-peptide and often even a higher than normal result. They are often still making insulin it’s just not enough to meet their needs because of insulin resistance. I have T2 patients who sometimes take concentrated insulins off label in their pumps. 


I had a T2 new to Omnipod 5 recently, pod only lasts 1.5 days, ICR 1:2. Patient has to take other drugs like Ozempic just to control blood sugars, even with >100 units of insulin a day. Insulin resistance is still in play with T2 diabetes. Yes, people with t1 diabetes can also have insulin resistance but usually not to the extent I see with T2. It still happens, it is just far less common. The diseases have completely different causes that can be seen throughout the course of someone’s life with diabetes."

It’s just bad education all around and it compounds the misunderstandings that already exist regarding T1. 

I lost a huge amount of weight 2 1/2 years ago and the number of people I know who were aware that I had T1 before, all were seemingly shocked that I both still have diabetes and still require insulin is astonishing.

Yes, the diseases present similarly but they have different root causes & must be treated differently even though they use the same medications & tools.  Or leave “Diabetes” as the umbrella term but give the world better definitions for the types/classifications under it. 

When I was first diagnosed in 1992 I was told I had “type 1 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus” also called “juvenile diabetes” and that the biggest difference between types 1 & 2 were that a type 2’s body could still make & use their own insulin whereas mine could not. I asked how they knew I had type 1. “Well, because you are still a child and only children get type 1.”  I was 15 but I accepted the answer because I was 15 & they seemed to know their stuff.  

30+ years later we’ve learned much more about the disease & how to live with & manage it. We need 30 years worth of better definitions for it. It’s not cut & dry like it was when I was a kid. I think that Diabetes is much like Autism in that it’s a spectrum rather than something simple (like a broken bone maybe). There are many variables & many ways to treat those different variables.

Apply [cluestick](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cluestick) until the doctor is cured of willfully disseminating disinformation.  All they have to do is say ""sometimes T2 progresses into needing insulin to treat it"" and/or ""aspirin is a pain reliever and can also reduce the risk of heart attacks; insulin can be prescribed for different afflictions too"" rather than make shit up.

Should we call it ""type 1 mellitus"" instead so it'll click for anyone with enough medical knowledge to know the distinction between types but generate ""what's that?""s from everyone else to prompt an explanation about autoimmune disease?  Also because I'm a real sweetie."

Type 2 diabetes is most likely caused by unhealthy lifestyle, age, being over weight etc, and can be managed without insulin. Type1 diabetic would die without insulin because our pancreas does not reproduce it at all.

We literally cannot make insulin or many other hormones anymore. 

What you have sounds like LADA, type 1 onset in adults can be a much slower onset. It can be tested for with antibodies like anything else and if there are no antibodies it is not type 1.

Yes, unfortunately doctors and endos can be clueless and out of date and not know about LADA. 

Regardless the ""gatekeeping"" worry you have is actively harmful. The lives of type 1s are in danger when people misunderstand the nature of our disease. If a bunch of type 2s ""with unusual symptoms"" who nevertheless are NOT type 1, go around saying they have type 1, people will misunderstand our disease even more.

And yes, there is a lot we do not know yet. It wasn't that long ago, and many people still do, believe that T1 is exclusive to juveniles. Change in mentality and long held beliefs takes time, which is why helping spread proper information is needed."

The American Diabetes Association, JDRF, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists convened a research symposium, “The Differentiation of Diabetes by Pathophysiology, Natural History and Prognosis” on 10–12 October 2015. 

“While type 1 diabetes results from immune-mediated destruction of β-cells and type 2 diabetes is primarily associated with glucose-specific insulin secretory defects, there is growing evidence of significant overlap across the spectrum of diabetes. For example, β-cell mass is also reduced in people with type 2 diabetes (67). In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the stress response induced by hyperglycemia may play a role in β-cell apoptosis (68). Changes in β-cell phenotype associated with hyperglycemia may reflect a dedifferentiation of β-cells important to the natural history and staging of diabetes (69). Clearly, an insufficient number or functional decline of β-cells is central to hyperglycemia and the downstream complications of diabetes. Understanding the state of the β-cell is key to defining subtypes of diabetes."

Quite frankly the fact that you're calling this a ""club"" mentality when for *type 1 diabetics this is literally life and death* says it all.

"T2 ""turning into"" T1-can anyone help me to explain to others with data resources they are different diseases even if there are commonalities in symptoms?","There is a prevalence of this being parroted on reddit and am at a loss to explain anymore. Loss of beta cells in T2 does not mean they are a T1 (they can be functionally treated in a similar fashion, but the causes of both differ) so why would you now state a t2 is called a t1 and medically classified as such? **This is not a debate about T1 vs T2 but about why people will state a T2 will ""turn into"" a T1.** I have run into explaining this a few times just in the last few days. There seems to be a lack of understanding that two different diseases and disease states can have similar treatments, but hey are not the same disease. I would never say a patient with a melanoma now has liver cancer because they both require chemotherapy.

I have had discussions with a doctor who stated it's ""easier to explain to patients"" by telling a T2 they are now T1 because they prescribed insulin. I'm at a loss-there is enough misunderstanding about types, disease pathways, causes and treatments.  Constant misunderstandings affect all types and how we are treated in medical situations. Your thoughts?

Edit-further to this in T1 there are other issues other than exogenous insulin. We’re looking at amylin, possible dysfunction of the alpha cells and feedback system, and other issues.

In the US, use of insulin would qualify you for a meter and test strips for 4-5 times a day testing. Typical T2 on metformen or other oral medications are covered for a meter and once a day testing (usually before breakfast). T2 diabetics who adjust their insulin dose (use correction factors or carb counting) would qualify for a cgm, although insurance coverage will vary by company. Both my father and boyfriend are T2, and I have known many T2s. I am surprised to hear that NHS doesn't better care for their T2 community. Yes, often tie personal choices play a big role in the severity of T2, but it is still a health disorder with serious consequences. It is also possible to still have (or be diagnosed) T2 at a healthy weight and paying attention to what you eat. Misdiagnosis of T1.5 as T2 is also very common, and failing to check blood sugars regularly could have disastrous results for a T1.5 patient whose islet cells are being killed off slowly."
Tbh I don’t know a whole lot about how my insulin ratios should look. I have a t-slim pump. Does anyone know the general math surrounding that? I’m just trying to understand my diabetes for myself.,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14p1t2n,"In general, it’s roughly 50% basal, 50% bolus/correction. 

BUT….that’s a general rule. What’s more important is A1c, TIR, % low, and overall picture. My basal is usually about 2/3 of my total insulin, but my team doesn’t care because everything else is good. 

It’s all about what your body needs to keep running as best it can."

The 65% TIR is a little below target, but you’re not having many (if any) lows, so the answer has to be cutting down on the highs. 

The almost 50/50 basal/bolus split looks right about average."

coming back from a severe weigh loss due to dibetic ketoacidosis,"Context:

I was diagnosed in May 2020 at the age of 18. During my debut, I experienced diabetic ketoacidosis, which lasted for approximately 3 weeks. 

I'm sure everyone in this sub already knows this but I will explain it just in case: during a diabetic ketoacidosis the body degrades fat and muscle to generate energy resulting in an extremely fast and unhealthy weight loss.

In the 3 weeks that my ketoacidosis lasted I lost 22 lbs (10 kg). The first photo is from the day I was discharged from the hospital. For reference, I am 178 cm (5'10"") tall and weighed 59 kg (130 lbs).

In the second photo, I gained 24 lbs (11 kg) after 3 years of going to the gym. I weighed 70 kg (154 lbs). I didn't consistently go to the gym during those 3 years because, due to the extreme muscle loss, my shoulder stabilizer muscles were too weak. When I returned to the gym, I instantly injured myself, and I had to slowly regain my muscle mass. I dedicated almost an entire year to rehabilitation exercises to restore the health of my shoulders enough to be able to do bench presses or pull-ups again. 
In summary, that's it. I just wanted to share my progress and know if anyone had a similar experience :)",https://i.redd.it/cqpyfyc9ue9b1.png,Bro congrats. I gained 15 lbs the first month as well. It's amazing what all appropriate hormones do to a body. My mustache is now finally con necting to my chin hair :)

edit: I forgot to answer your question, hell yeah I feel a lot  healthier, specially mentally  , the reason I don't have a picture from the front of 2020 is because I couldn't look at myself, I felt horrible , the image I have in my mind of myself and the image I looked at in the mirror didn't match at all, nowadays I feel really really comfortable in my skin, I think this is because my body from 2020 was a body that I was forced into by diabetes and my physique now is a body that I willingly made with mi efforts, something about that just make me happy when i look I myself."
coming back from a severe weigh loss due to dibetic ketoacidosis,"Context:

I was diagnosed in May 2020 at the age of 18. During my debut, I experienced diabetic ketoacidosis, which lasted for approximately 3 weeks. 

I'm sure everyone in this sub already knows this but I will explain it just in case: during a diabetic ketoacidosis the body degrades fat and muscle to generate energy resulting in an extremely fast and unhealthy weight loss.

In the 3 weeks that my ketoacidosis lasted I lost 22 lbs (10 kg). The first photo is from the day I was discharged from the hospital. For reference, I am 178 cm (5'10"") tall and weighed 59 kg (130 lbs).

In the second photo, I gained 24 lbs (11 kg) after 3 years of going to the gym. I weighed 70 kg (154 lbs). I didn't consistently go to the gym during those 3 years because, due to the extreme muscle loss, my shoulder stabilizer muscles were too weak. When I returned to the gym, I instantly injured myself, and I had to slowly regain my muscle mass. I dedicated almost an entire year to rehabilitation exercises to restore the health of my shoulders enough to be able to do bench presses or pull-ups again.

I don't think it was a conscious thing at the time, but looking back, I definitely avoided coming to terms with how skinny and unhealthy I looked. 

It was only when my soccer coach, who is unabashedly blunt but also has my wellbeing in mind, told me that I looked ""gaunt"" in the face that I really accepted that my weight loss was unnaturally large. And this is really what prompted me to book an appointment with the GP."

1. i use fat grips when I do weighted pull-ups (around 6 sets per week). doing this i targets the muscles in the forearms that are responsible for gripping. In my last set of pull-ups, I perform a dead hang until failure.
2. i do dumbbell wrist curls and dumbbell wrist extensions  4 sets a week each , this is divided into 2 sessions. the wrist extensions also helped a lot to fix some elbow pain i had a few months ago.
3. i do 6 sets a week of reverse curls with an E-Z bar , divided into 2 sessions. this is mostly for isolating the brachiorradialis because i have pretty short biceps insertions and it helps with filling a little bit that space in the elbow.

i hope this helps !!!!, remember to not do what i do , if your are starting forearm isolation do max 1 set of every exercise i listed and add more sets as you progress."
Freestyle Libre 2 very sensitive?,"Question for the Freestyle peeps! I've recently been diagnosed T1D (31M) and I'm trialling the FL2 before my doctor adds it to my prescription and I'm noticing that my readings tend to vary wildly. I've had a few alarms telling me I'm low (below 3.9) but, upon doing a fingerprick, can see that I'm around 5. Just this second had an alarm to say I'm high (over 12.0) but just tested and I'm 10.2.
Is this normal behaviour with the FL2? I know it's not overly accurate, but getting a low/high alarm is quite distressing and can be frustrating when testing shows that it's not actually the case.

Treated it and went back to sleep. Now that it's morning and I look at my overnight graph it doesn't show a low (I alarmed at 3.9 and the lowest my graph shows is 5.2) so obviously the alert was false. However, I'll take a false alert rather than missing one any day!

It's all a learning curve. It's my third CGM system and by far my favourite. I get the least amount of false alarms with it and I love the tiny size."

Unexplainable Blood Sugar Swings,"Hi!
I’ve never really posted anything on here but I sort of am creating this post to receive some further help and insight. A little context… I am an 18 year old male who was diagnosed with t1d at the nimble age of 2 years old and recently I have been struggling to manage this condition. My blood sugar seems to go high for no reason and my insulin sensitivity has become very inconsistent. Meaning one day I’ll use like maybe max 30 units of insulin and the next I’ll require as much as 60. It’s really frustrating and I have no reason why this is happening. I have been giving a lot more effort and attention to my blood sugar management in recent years and honestly I have never found it to be as hard to manage in my entire life. I literally have no explanation for why I seem to be running high lately. Most days it feels like I am literally injecting water and the insulin seems to be having little to no effect on my blood sugar whatsoever and before you ask yes all of my insulin isn't expired and is stored well. I also weightlifter for about an hour every day and run a total of 2 miles and am fairly lean so I feel I should be requiring a lot less insulin and should be way more sensitive than I currently am. If anyone has any further suggestions or insight for why I might be recently so insulin resistance I would leave to here it thank you guys!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ot0rd/unexplainable_blood_sugar_swings/,"I feel like stress, hormones etc effect every diabetic differently and some don't have problems like unexpected/explainable swings. I am one of the ones with the 'unexplainable'. 

From what I've gathered in my 22 years being diabetic and research rabbit holes it has a lot to do with your liver. The liver stores glucose for times of stress but cant differentiate when you actually need it - like an amnoying friend trying to be helpful but screwing things up most of the time. Good guy liver was helpful back in the day when we were cavemen living on a Savanah. In times of stress like being chased by a lion, the liver would release a sudden burst of glucose so that you would have the extra energy to fight or flight. Nowadays our stress isn't normally coming from being chased - It's things like a job interview, a cup of coffee causing an adrenaline rush or having to talk to your overbearing mother. If you have a lot of lows in a row or you dont eat enough for the liver to keep up you can deplete your liver of its glucose stores - I believe this is why some people find keto diets so effective for diabetics - once the liver is depleted you don't have that unknown glucose to worry about (I don't do keto or advise this, just saying). I also find if I go low while in bed and don't get up to treat right away sometimes good guy liver will step in and bring me up on its own. 

So whenever I'm having a tough BG day or unexplainable highs I blame good guy liver trying to help as that annoying friend lol it makes me so much less stressed having something to blame"

I also weightlifter for about an hour every day and run a total of 2 miles and am fairly lean so I feel I should be requiring a lot less insulin and should be way more sensitive than I currently am. If anyone has any further suggestions or insight for why I might be recently so insulin resistance I would leave to here it thank you guys!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14ot0rd/unexplainable_blood_sugar_swings/,"My daughter Loops. Here would be my thoughts:

\- where are you at with puberty? all done or any potential for a final growth spurt? 

\- what's your weight? 30 units for a teenage boy isn't a lot of insulin. Most adolescents need around 1 unit of insulin per KG - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6153068/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6153068/) but you probably would have seen this increased need when you were 14. Even 60 units doesn't sound like a lot for teenage boy, 60 units at 1:1 would be for 60 kg which is 132 pounds. 

\- you using Omnipod or Medtronic? Novolog or Humalog? It's possible your body is developing a resistance to Humalog or Novolog, it happens and switching over to the other insulin could help. If you are using ultra fast, a lot of loopers have reported that FIASP and Lyumyev eventually stop working consistently (that's in the minority but it's pretty well documented on the FB Looped and Loop and learn groups). We had an issue with Humalog being inconsistent and the issues went away after switching to Novolog.

\- if you are using Pods, there can be issues with day 1 and day 3 pods. We had no issues with Novolog but with both Humalog and Fiasp, we need to change the pods early and give some phantom carbs on the pod change.

How are you calculating TDI? Nightscout / AppleHealth or Tidepool? Nightscout's calculations can be a little off, I find Tidepool the easiest to read.  


Any other patterns as to when the insulin needs seem to be higher? I'd track time of day, what day of the infusion set I was on, how long was my pre-bolus. One issue with TDI and loop is depending on your settings, your bolus can be late, you get stuck on a high and the Loop algo doesn't account for people having a higher insulin resistance at higher blood sugar numbers. AAPS does have a feature to handle that.

Do you use the custom type one patches for loop? I find those make it a lot easier to avoid avoid highs.

We had a LOT of inconsistent days for my daughter and the consensus was growth hormones."

Also you can share your data with your endo. 

30 units per day sounds wayyyyyy too low that’s like 50% of your weight in kg. My guess is your TDI should be around 40 at least - https://www.wcu.edu/WebFiles/PDFs/CalculatingInsulin.pdf 

I suppose it’s possible that a lean and athletic boy could have less insulin needs than average (and that’s certainly often true for adults) but teenagers almost always have higher insulin needs than average.

help,so i think i may have just injected my long acting into a muscle. i went from 100 to 45 within 30 min. what are some suggestions? i had some glucose tabs,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14oq5l3/help/,Or maybe a vein/capillary.  It has happened to me before and all of a sudden I have so many lows.
Another frustration in the life of T1D (rant/vent),"I went to Kings Island today with a couple of friends and bought their famous blue ice cream. Now I usually don't eat full sugar ice cream but I considered it a treat because I was with my friends and didn't want to be left out and let's face it, a girl just wants ice cream sometimes. 🥺 Anyway as y'all know one-off shops like that aren't required to post nutritional information online. I bolused for 45g but feel like I underbolused... but also was afraid of going low if I'd overbolused. My friends were appalled that I couldn't find accurate nutrition info (I mean I am too but I'm used to it by this point) so they asked first the ice cream shop workers who tried to find out but didn't know (theyre hourly workers so I don't blame them) and then guest services. Guest services also didn't know (again, not surprisingly) but they tried calling the company that supplies the ice cream to find out. After another 15 minutes, they came back with this number (see pic). The guest services lady was so kind and so proud of herself for finding the ""sugar amount"" that I didn't have the heart to tell her how wrong the information is. Pardon my French but WHAT THE HELL? FIVE grams of sugar in one serving of full sugar, LARGE amusement park ice cream? My friends who know little about average carb amounts and T1D were pleased with the info, thanked the lady, and we left, but this experience is evidence of ongoing struggles with this disease. Really taught me not to trust what uninformed people say about sugar/carbs, as well-meaning as they are. Trust your gut if you think nutrition information given to you is way too high or too low. It sucks but ultimately when you are the one that has to deal with the disease, you will understand the disease way better than anyone else. In retrospect, maybe I should have told the guest services lady how wrong the info she gave me was, because we really was going out of her way to try out. But at that point we'd been there for 15 minutes trying to confirm a number I'd guessed on already and I knew they wouldn't be able to find accurate nutrition info.",https://i.redd.it/lnb0cwuntg9b1.jpg,How’d your glucose end up treating you after this?

Misdiagnosed?,"I honestly really don’t know where to start.

Feb 2021 was diagnosed as T1DM after being in hospital for 3 days with Sugars of 33.5mmol/l and ketones of 3.3mmol/l, at the time I had Covid and was on prednisolone.

Soon realised after 6 months I was having a lot of hypos and not any highs, so I stopped taking insulin, 1.5 years later I’m still here.

Recent blood work shows no T1 Antibodies and an A1C of 37.

Fast forward to now and I’m noticing erratic blood sugars where I’m staying high for prolonged periods.

My practice are still giving me Libre 2 CGMs to monitor any potential fuckiness and I’m also having Zinc Transporter antibody test soon.

What are the chances of me actually being diabetic if any type?",https://i.redd.it/e3cz5j4f5k9b1.jpg,"Did they test for all autoantibodies and a most current c-peptide test? And did they test for all possible types including MODY types? I've heard a lot about diagnoses during covid and some people were thought to be T1 but weren't; there's a whole subject we don't know about. Was it the viral attack causing a temporary dysfunction of your endocrine system, plus the prednisone known to increase bg to very high levels? Is that how you were diagnosed or what other tests pointed to type 1?

All anyone can suggest is keep getting labs done and hopefully you have a very knowledgeable Endo who can guide you through this. Keep us posted!"

Throw in steroids on top of that, and I can see all kinds of metabolic weirdness resulting. Much of that would be expected to resolve once the immediate crisis passed and steroids were discontinued. 

That aside, what you went through may have been a big enough shock to your metabolism that it set you on the path to T2D, or it may have caused an autoimmune response which has been at a slow burn and now you’re noticing the smoke. 

I’d think your CGM data would be enough to justify at least continued monitoring of CGM data and some periodic labs so that they’re ready to intervene with appropriate treatments when things cross back over the line into “diabetes” territory."

My guess is low is better. The reason they freak out about low is because if you go lower than 60 you could pass out and not be able to help yourself.

70 is when I take action at night usually milk. I prefer to have my wife in between 60-90 during sleep and 100-120 awake. At 90-100 I take action when awake
I prefer higher 120 for awake because that leaves her room to do physical stuff without dropping outside of that range.

*Just last week I had a discussion with my wife's Endo about this and he basically said they'd prefer lower if you can avoid going too low but he could not explain why. ***Assuming you're in range. He said nothing would happen by being 60 or 120...

All bets are off if you're below 60 or above 120.

*Constant highs will cause clots/bleeding in your eyes that is not detectable by you but can be seen by the eye doc. Eventually these get so bad you end up with blind spots. Usually this is 300+ range for weeks and months. It doesn't happen just from a few random highs. It happens when you binge drink or any other multi day activity where you ignore your diabetes.

Overall it sounds like you have your diabetes under control. A lot of people will kill for the control you have lol. Be proud of yourself you've accomplished what very very few diabetics have!! Congrats!"

From what you’ve described it doesn’t sound like you are upping your risk of complications with the slightly higher readings, especially if you are still at about 90% TIR. 

**Disclaimer (so no one thinks I’m trying to give treatment/medical advice): I’m not a doctor, don’t play one on TV and do not recommend going against doctors advice, the following is what** *I* **do because I have a good understanding of how** *I* **respond**. With the help of my trusty CGM I have recently started trying to head highs and lows off before they become highs and lows. If I’m at 80 and the arrow is trending down I’ll take a shot of juice or eat a couple M&Ms. If I’m at 170 and trending up I may take a little insulin- the amount depends on what I ate, how long ago I ate, and the time of day (if I had rice an hour ago, I should have known better and that ish will come back down on its own). I’m not quite where you are yet but I’m sitting at 83% in range with 1% low, 13% 181-250 and 4% greater than 250 (f$&@ you dawn effect). 

What I have always heard from my various providers is basically that lows can go very bad, much more quickly (passing out, seizures, death) than highs. 

Highs aren’t good but issues are generally more cumulative and if you are paying attention there is usually more time to correct before things go completely sideways. As with all things diabetes this generalization may not be true for all people/situations. 

My endo prefers fewer lows. That said, there’s low and there’s **LOW**, and I was going **LOW**; 30-50 with some regularity. 

The way it was explained to me, regularly going into the 40s and lower ups the risk of irreversible damage to the brain and brain function as well as seizures. As mentioned above there is added concern because low lows can become a catastrophic problem rather quickly. 

I grew up with a T1 uncle who had seizures every couple years or so, so that was a big concern for me when I was diagnosed. I now know that he was uncontrolled but he also didn’t have the access to same tech or meds we have available now (this would have been the 90’s early 2000’s)."

I’ve been lucky enough to bear witness to quite a few of these events, where my bg doesn’t fluctuate more than 20-30 points through mealtime.

Admittedly though, this isn’t always what happens, more typically I will spike to a high of 160-170 around 45 minutes after I eat and go down from there, until I get back to my baseline in another 45 minutes to an hour or so. 

Being at 200-250 isn’t a terribly big deal, but having these high glucoses sustained for 3-4 hours may be long enough to start damaging things if it happens frequently. Honestly, pre-blousing and an accurate carb count aren’t enough for me a lot of the time; the only way I get insulin to work the way I want it to work is with exercise and a healthy diet. Some Type 1 Diabetics do just fine eating whatever and being sedentary and I commend them, but I find if I don’t have at least a 10-15 minute walk prior to eating that my insulin just doesn’t “work” and I’ll go high. Moreover, if my food doesn’t have enough fiber, the same thing happens. I eat a tooooon of vegetables to help with this."

As long as your CGM is typically well calibrated, its average is based on actual sugars. There are people who have issues with calibration, so for those, it is also important to look at A1c. A1c values can be affected by many things, including anemia (iron deficiency), blood loss, kidney failure, liver disease, and conditions that affect the life span of red blood cells ([niddk.nih.gov](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diagnostic-tests/a1c-test)). A1c has also been shown to be less accurate for people of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent ([diatribe.org](https://diatribe.org/limitations-a1c-how-does-a1c-vary-race-and-ethnicity)).

Personally, my A1c is typically almost a full point below the dexcom estimate, but I have chronic anemia (my A1c has always seemed oddly low - I didnt learn why until about 5 years ago) and kidney injury (early stages of kidney disease). 

Many doctors are going away from A1c because it can also only measure an average sugar over the last 3 months, meaning if you are always bouncing from high to low, your A1c can be great. Using a combination of time in range and average glucose from a continuous glucose monitor is superior to depending on the A1c results, provided you can trust the accuracy of the CGM."

I have had more highs on Tandem (I hate going above 160, over 200 was rare for me) because of their shitty infusion sets.  I was using Mio Advanced on Medtronic, they are fantastic.  The Autosoft 90/XC sets suck.  They hurt going it, I often bruise, Ive had more bloody cannulas than in 18 years on Medtronic.  I can’t use TruSteel, they hurt like someone is gnawing on a nerve.  I can only wear angled sets in my abdomen and I’ve worn that out after 16 years of using those so that’s why i switched to a 90 degree set last year.

Covid pandemic linked to surge in child and teen diabetes,,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66054946,"There's actually a current theory among endocrinologist and researches that viruses can lay dormant in the pancreas causing the autoimmune response, laying dormant doesn't mean dead, it just means it stays in hiatus, only cloning near the end of the life cycle to stay there until opportunity arises. Sadly this was only a theory at the time, I'm pretty sure I read a proposal on a research study for it that was denied because ''you can't infect people with a virus to see if it'll lay dormant in their pancreas to develop diabetes.''  and ''we can't start a pandemic just to have a research group big enough.'' So when the pandemic hit us, one of my thoughts was, well maybe now they can start that research study I read about. Think positive right?"

Covid pandemic linked to surge in child and teen diabetes,,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66054946,"I’m definitely not surprised by this. This isn’t anything new. Just new to Covid, since, ya know, it’s new. 

I was diagnosed in 1994 and my doctor said mine was most likely caused by chronic strep I had as a kid.  there were studies at the time linking immune response and strep, measles, mumps, and maybe some others like hepatitis. Basically, the virus lies relatively dormant via a completely-above-my-knowledge molecular mimicry and the islet cells are especially vulnerable. 

Also fun fact about our amazing immune systems, I got Covid back in October of 2022, omicron variant, was positive for six weeks, got pre-pneumonia fluid and inflammation, was incredibly sick. And, awesomely enough, I had an outbreak of shingles because my immune system just wants to burn everything to the ground. 

Anyway, it’s really interesting to see how viral and bacterial pathogens can either kick start, accelerate, or increase susceptibility in developing T1D."

Covid pandemic linked to surge in child and teen diabetes,,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66054946,"My son was diagnosed with TD1 at the beginning of the Covid19 when covid was very new and unknown to a lot of people and even authorities.I made a post here after he was diagnosed with type1diabetic that covid caused him to develop type1diabetic!  So many people here attacked me, and they said I was wrong! But now you can see there are many, many studies that show and prove this fact and many other people who say it was the covid that caused this disease! Covid is a viral infection, and I do not have any doubt that COVID19 did this to him. There is no family history of type1diabetic from both sides of our families and not even type 2 diabetic. He got very  sick with all the covid 19 symptoms, took a few months until he felt better, and then 4 months after covid, he developed type1diabetic with A1C of 6.9, the only reason they said he has type1diabetic was because of Autoantibodies presence in his body!  Another important fact that proofs he did not have hidden  type1diabetic before covid, is we had a full blood test prior to his sickness ( We were traveling out of country so we had to do a blood test including blood sugar test which was completely normal).  Yes, I believe covid attacked my son's pancreas and caused him this heartbreaking disease! The medical industries are all ignorant of this fact even that they say infections play a real role and trigger this disease, but they are not going after the treatments of this disease based on root cause!!! Its sad that all they do to add a new insulin pump or bs glucose device to the market only for their own profit!!! Even the recent FDA approval of stem cell therapy, which is only another financial gain for them!!! What's the point of the stem cell when you can get several other diseases such as cancer and etc. I even have doubts that they already know what the real reason behind this is, and they already also know how to cure it for good! But why do it, when they can make billions on us! If they know how to give type1diabetic to a healthy mouse or bunny, then indeed they know the cause and the cure!"

Covid pandemic linked to surge in child and teen diabetes,,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66054946,"I see this response every time this topic comes up but I think it’s important to highlight the different pathogenesis of diabetes when covid is suspected to be the culprit. There have been increasing reports of type 1 diabetes in patients who are autoantibody negative. There was also a study published about the SARS outbreak in 2004 where the patients developed insulin dependent diabetes. They were slowly weened off insulin and after 3 years, only a couple remained insulin dependent. Some reports are suggesting covid-19 hijacks ace-2 receptors causing the host to lose glycemic control. Others suggest a cytokine storm directly damages the pancreas. Regardless, there are strange anomalies occurring after this pandemic that warrant a discussion.

It’s long been believed that sickness can trigger autoimmune diseases.  I was diagnosed in the mid-80’s with T1.  I had a bad case of the flu the winter before my diagnosis and my doctor believed that that was the culprit, as there was no history of T1 in my family before me.

However, you can almost always find juice or soda somewhere. 

Therefore, I think it's fucked for security to deny you, and sounds illegal to me (assuming you're American). I'm shocked even EMS didn't back you up. 

I'm not T1D but my 12yo daughter is and I'm always trying to plan for scenarios like this with her. 

If I were you, in addition to having tabs, I'd save some literature on my phone so I can quickly refer them to laws about accommodations for disabilities, which includes T1D, and literature on why you would need juice.  

If I was really trying to go the extra mile, I'd try to find some examples of businesses being sued for similar refusals. 

But the sad reality is that this is going to happen sometimes so your best answer is probably tablets, like most people here have said. My daughter doesn't like them either, but keeps them with her just in case.

Edit: here's a good place to start.

""Red River Valley Fair Association (RRVFA) Settlement Agreement

""The fair organization, RRVFA, had a policy which barred all outside food and drink. A parent and their child with type 1 diabetes initiated a complaint which alleged discrimination, as the child needed snacks to maintain blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. The RRVFA agreed to allow individuals with disabilities to obtain an exception to the general prohibition against outside food and drink upon request. (Oct. 2019)""

I just like to carry an emergency little juice incase i miss any symptoms early and go very low (ive missed a sign or two in a gig when its already hot, im already sweating and head is pounding with music)

They are less than 2$ per a travel tube of 10. That’s cheaper than a can of juice for every time you need a boost. And you probably only need to keep one on you and would only really need to rely on them for these sorts of strict locations. 

I suspect we aren’t going to agree on what is the most reasonable expectations here. Generally only bars and concert venues are going to have a fit. But the idea that every bouncer or gate keeper is supposed to either take people at their word that they need to break the rules or have any familiarity of T1D doesn’t seem realistic. 

I grant they aren’t exactly appetizing but get the job done and are equal or more convenient to food items by virtually any measure: smaller, cheaper, more stable/portable.  Personally, I would rather just take the half eaten tube I’ve had for years now and skip all the hassle and waste of time just so my pickmeup can be tastier."

The cure was roughly five years away when I was diagnosed in 1991.

The cure was roughly five years away when I transitioned from pediatric endocrinology to adult endocrinology in 2004.

The cure was roughly five years away when I had to totally reorient my life for reasons unrelated to diabetes in 2010.

The cure was roughly five years away when my first child was born in 2016.

The cure was roughly five years away when I became a single parent in 2020.

The cure is roughly five years away this very second.

The cure will be roughly five years away five years from now.

The cure will be roughly five years away when I die from complications of diabetes and a misled life.

Assuming there are still humans and a functional society (doubtful) a century from now, the cure will be roughly five years away.

The day they cure the fucking thing, the cure will be five years away.

The only real downside is the Guardian (I'm using the Guardian 4) sensor. Between the 2-piece construction, cleaning and charging the transmitter, using 2 tapes, the applicator, you're either lugging around a ton of stuff or have to do it at home. Also, you're around 3h without sensor data due to the time in takes to clean and charge the transmitter + 2h warm up time. At least it is usually super accurate.

They do have a new sensor in the works, but when that releases is anyone's guess.

Just heard about this from my youngest son's diabetic camp.,https://i.redd.it/p15zxwf6fg9b1.png,"T1d is hard to catch in its initial stages, family members with others who already have t1d are at higher risk of developing it, so they are doing screenings for family members of t1d so they can catch it in its earlier stages of development and hopefully find patients willing to participate in other trials to potentially test different drugs/methods to slow or stop the progression into t1d.

They had some success with tzield which can possibly delay the onset for a while, but they are still looking for something that can stop it completely.

If it's still early enough from your diagnosis they might also have trials aimed at extending the honeymoon phase."

He didn’t really speak until he was about 4 (and now he’s 11 and will talk your ear off), and my big worry was that he could be having symptoms and they could be misinterpreted as or masked by autism behaviors or sensory reactions (or kid stuff like leaving a million glasses of water all over the house) and we wouldn’t know until he was REALLY sick. So we got him enrolled to just see if he has any markers (yay- none!) and if we needed to put that worry closer to the front. That doesn’t guarantee he won’t become T1, but it greatly lessens the level of worry I have about it."

Summer and lows,"A bit of a rant. 
I used to love summers, but since diagnosed i am struggling with the heat and lows. 
I usually feel that im low when i get hot - but since its summer and we have a heatwave - i feel hot all the time, which leads to me not noticing a low and letting it go untreated to the point of almost fainting (for example - today i realised i should check my sugar was at a point that i felt drunk and my sugar was already 1,3mmol/l). I hate that diabetes is making me hate summer… i used to love it. 

P.S. - before anyone recomends getting sensors and pump - none of that is covered in my country and the expenses to cover them pretty much are the same as renting another apartment. So while i tehnically can afford it, i cant justify doing that to my family - since i wouldnt be able to participate in paying rent, groceries, etc. Bleep diabetes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14o74mj/summer_and_lows/,"I always reduce my basal for the summer.

To avoid or limit lows (as much as possible) I ate meals/snacks that wold carry me for several hours e.g., peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This provided a ""window"" of safety but still required more frequent blood glucose tests. Its only takes a few moments giving you a real number. I always planned a day in advance and reduced my long acting insulin.

It's best to not get so low that you feel ""drunk"" or other low symptoms. This is dangerous and will accelerate the onset of hypoglycemia unawareness and that is a very hard life without sensor and pump.

Does cupping help with lipohypertrophy?,,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14oe0qz/does_cupping_help_with_lipohypertrophy/,"No. The only thing that helps with lipohypertrophy is time and avoiding injections/pump sites in that area.


Topical ointments can help with the superficial stuff but the scar tissue has to heal over time. If it's really bad derm/plastics may need to be consulted to remove some of the tissue if it won't heal."

My endo said, ""That's lipohypertrophy.  Stop injecting there.""   Huh.  Ok.   So I asked, what can I do about it?  She said try and massage it when you shower and time.    It's looking a little better, but it's still lumpy and unattractive.   I can't do my arms, I've tried.  It's just too awkward.    So now I'm belly, and hips, and upper butt.

On my diagnosis day I asked the nurse what about very thin people, what about elderly people with thin skin and less body fat?? I was promptly told not to think that far into the future or worry about other thin diabetics. But mind just ran to what a life time of injections is going to be like."

Dexcom G7 - I Genuinely Like It,"I’ve not seen even one positive post about the G7 since its launch, so I was dubious about trying it. After holding my endo hostage in the office for 30 minutes to unleash a barrage of questions about it, my endo gave me two sensors to try, and I truly liked it, so I changed my prescription. 

I used the G6 for 5 years (after 13 years of finger sticks and a horrible year with Medtronic’s early CGM beast) before trying the G7, and I can earnestly say that I like the G7 more. I use the clarity feature within the app, and I enjoy the more precise ways in which you can tailor the notification settings. I’ve had one sensor fail so far and Dexcom sent me a new one. My G6 sensors would fail alllll the time, so this isn’t new.

The 30 minute warm up is surprisingly accurate without the g6’s hours of becoming acclimated. We are on manual mode with O5 so being compatible with a pump right now isn’t necessary for us. I don’t know what to make of people’s connection issues with bluetooth. It hasn’t been our experience at all.

Being regular helps but diabetes isn't on a schedule. If it chooses to go wild, it will. BG levels are influenced by a lot of things, including your stress levels. I understand your dad is worried but he should learn more about the disease. 

Diabetes requires constant adjustments everyday. You cannot expect to apply the same ratios and the same schedules every time. I personally am quite rigorous but you also need flexibility for different needs. Going out to the restaurant means a totally different set of things compared to eating at home. 

There are things you can do: 

- eat some slow releasing glucose before going to bed if your BG is dropping. Helps prevent hypos during sleep. 

- exercise. Physical activity increases your BG control overall (but you have to be careful not to go too low, talk to your endo and dietist, everyone has different personal needs). Even a 10 min walk after eating helps quite a lot in avoiding spikes. 

- reduce the stressors in your life. Stress will increase your BG levels, other illnesses may influence your glucose production and management too. Being sick makes your BG go zig zag. 

I personally eat between 8.00 and 9.00 for breakfast, 12.45 and 13.45 at lunch and 20.15 to 21 in the evening. I snack halfway through the morning and afternoon if needed and before going to bed. 

Nothing stops you from eating during other times but it becomes increasingly difficult to manage if you need to bolus at 18.00 because you're out with friends and then you have dinner at 20.30. Insulin would still be active and you would need to accommodate for that in your CHO count."

When our two T1s were diagnosed, I was so stressed and worried about them all the time. They were very young (7 and 1), so not really doing any of the management, so we tended to stick to more of a schedule. Schedules do make it easier to manage, and while we still have kind of a loose schedule, life doesn’t always work that way. Since we’ve gotten dexcoms (and now pumps), we’re a lot more relaxed. Our oldest is firmly in stereotypical teenager mode, and sleeps until noon any time he can, and generally does not prefer to eat breakfast, and he’s doing fine. There are things we’re working with him on to improve his management, but he’s figuring it out. 

As a T1 parent, I can completely understand your dad’s anxiety, but he should absolutely not be passing that on to you. Ultimately your diabetes is yours to learn how to live with, not his. If you’re doing a good job managing yourself, he needs to back off. Depending on your age (especially if you’re still a minor), maybe you could ask your endo to have a discussion with him. You may also want to see if you can adjust your follower alert settings within your dexcom app, so maybe you can cut down on his notifications and therefore some of your messages from him. I don’t know how open he is to discussions, but his job in this is to support you in learning to manage/managing this on your own.

I do understand that he is very stressed with low sugar event. Some people recently died in their sleep due to hypoglycemia...
Either way those things happen sometimes, they should be very rare. If they are frequent, it's hazard for you and possibly require adjustment.

I assume that you are not using R and N insulin. Any of the newer types give you some freedom as to when you can eat. Were you told to eat on a specific schedule by your endo? That would be quite odd, and to my mind would be justification for finding a new endo or T1 care team..."

I’m allergic to aspartame and Sucralose. I am not complaining too much, not a good vibe about either and I did well avoiding them for the first 30 years of my life prior to my T1D diagnosis. However, during those “glory days” I guess I now think of them as, I did enjoy the occasional soda with lunch. Certainly not every day and most of the time just a couple of times a month. But now, I can’t have the diabetic safe options either. I have a wild reaction to pure sugar or juice so barring serious advancements in stem cell pancreases, I completely understand I will never have a whole coke or dr. pepper ever again in my life, even with all the insulin on the planet, but my dumb question is: if I safely budget for it maybe down the line when I’m more experienced with insulin dosing etc, could I have a sip? Even maybe 1-2oz over ice slowly, knowing it would certainly cause a jump if not a total spike? 

I should note, I’m positive that this has become an all consuming thought simply because I can’t or certainly should not have any regular soda period, and under my previous circumstances, the prospect of my next Coca Cola wouldn’t even be a vapor of an idea. 

And I don’t want anyone to think I’m the type of person who would simply have a coke and say screw the consequences. I am very type A. I am currently sitting at 99% in my slightly generous dexcom range of 70-180, 3 months into my diagnosis, which I think is fairly good, and dropped my A1C from 15 to 6.9 in 60 days which I know was quite fast but it was a huge instant lifestyle shift. I’m not playing games with my health. But I just can’t shake the idea of a nice refreshing soft drink right now.

A lot of businesses use “net carbs” as a marketing tool, but many diabetics just go with the full amount as that is usually the most correct. So olipop is marketing itself as a lower carb option due to the fibre, but that isn’t likely to work for a t1. 

Looking for drinks that are 0 calorie/0 carb are the safest for us. Zevia is one of those. Some diabetics may get a rise in sugars due to caffine, but this is way less likely in Diet Coke compared with coffee. 

All in all trial and error. IMO don’t get caught up in that net carb bs. A lot of us also have to bolus for protein and fat (not just carbs) so that might also be raising sugars."

How to stay motivated with lows and exercise,"I have been trying to get into fitness and going to the gym ever since my T1 diagnosis but haven’t been able to stay motivated. I’m underweight and have little to no muscle on me and want to just generally become stronger and get better stamina, but whenever in go to the gym, within 5-10 minutes of moderate exercise ( usually cardio but recently weight lifting ) my BG is 3.0 ( 53 ) going down and I have to stop for 20~ minutes before starting again. I have adjusted my basal for 2~ hours before and during the gym along with glucose tabs before and during exercise but nothing stops me from crashing. All of this has caused me to not want to go to the gym and not be motivated enough to go. Does anyone have any advice or any other ways to stop my BG from crashing so soon? My diabetes is well controlled and I’m in range 80-90% of the time other then these lows; I’m on the Dexcom G6 and Omnipod 5 if that helps or makes a difference",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14nzoqy/how_to_stay_motivated_with_lows_and_exercise/,"I’m sorry this is happening to you. I’ve had diabetes for 25 years and I still struggle with this and know how disheartening it can be. However, I have a few suggestions. Maybe try adjusting the basal 3 hours before (if possible) or if you regularly exercise at the same time of day, you could have a different basal setting with a much lower basal for that time of day. Also, instead of just glucose tabs before exercising, you could try a more substantial snack or meal, something with protein and carbs, and experiment with how much insulin you give yourself for that snack. I tend to get low when I do cardio as well so I usually put my pump in exercise mode at least 2 hours before hand, eat something like a protein bar and a piece of fruit, and only bolus for about half of the carbs. I also tend to have 2 glucose tabs as I get started. I still do sometimes get low, even with that but it doesn’t tend to be as severe. However, everybody is different and hopefully others have other suggestions in case these don’t work for you. I would also recommend reaching out to your doctor and seeing if they have an exercise specialist on staff. Sometimes hospitals have someone dedicated to helping diabetics figure out the best way to exercise and avoid super lows. I hope this is helpful and good luck!"

I have adjusted my basal for 2~ hours before and during the gym along with glucose tabs before and during exercise but nothing stops me from crashing. All of this has caused me to not want to go to the gym and not be motivated enough to go. Does anyone have any advice or any other ways to stop my BG from crashing so soon?

Usually cardio drops sugar levels and heavy weight lifting raises your sugar levels immediately after and in some cases you need a small correction dose when lifting heavy weights.

On a non diabetic note I'd say if you are trying to put on some weight then I'd avoid cardio and concentrate on eating more food and lifting weights instead. You are potentially hitting the cardio with some active insulin and that's causing you to nose dose into your 3s, I personally wouldn't work out below 5 so try taking some quick acting sugar before and see how that affects it and aim to be at the higher end of your range.

Remember your body will be more sensitive to insulin after working out and it's common to have low sugar levels between 6-8 hours after working out !

I work out 5-6 days a week and been diabetic for the majority of my life so feel free to DM if you have more questions"

I’ll definitely try to start exercising at a regular time like you said as well as put my Omnipod on active mode a few hours before exercising. I’ll start trying to exercise at times when I’m more resistant to insulin and try all the other things too. Thanks :)

They were claiming that the sweetener was way worse for you than sugar is, so, for non-diabetics, they said regular softdrinkes were better than the diet ones.

Well... we spent about 6 Hours researching together. And by that i MEAN it. We read multiple studies, even specifically dissecting how legit the studies were by looking at how scientificially accurate their testing methods were. 

What we found after our long research : Not only is aspartame not known to cause any health detriments in already healthy people, it was A LOT better than sugar in pretty much any way and EVEN outclassed WATER in some points.

In one of the studies we looked at, each participant was schooled on how to correctly keep books of what they ate and the caloric values of what they ate as well as their health such as weight. Then they were observed ""normally"" for 6 weeks, just eating/drinking what they wanted to get a baseline. Then all drinks they had were given to them by the researchers for another 12 weeks. 6 of those they got a special-made softdrink with aspartame, another 6 weeks they got one with sugar. The drinks were made to be as similar as possible in taste, and the participants did not know wether they would get aspartame or sugar first.

Turns out, during the time the got aspartame the average caloric intake in subjects went down, their consumption of sweets and candy had reduced and they reported feeling less hungry in general."

The point of the, as I said, sarcastic comment on the original Reuters article (which, so far as I could determine, did not include ""pickle"" anywhere) is that bad pickling can kill you, along with working nights.

But, whatever; this is why Reddit is fucked.  It's full of arseholes who can't read a sentence of more than 144 characters without forgetting the -145'th."

When I went for the followup after my first blood work done my Doctor told me my A1C was at 12.6% (and bless his heart cuz I know he was trying his best not freak me out anymore) but he did tell that this wasn’t good and that I was for sure diabetic lol. And now my most recent A1C is at 7% and with a 78%+ time in range for the month of June. My Endo and PCP made me feel so good about myself saying how bringing it down by about 5% in only 5 months is amazing and with good time in range. I was so happy I almost started crying right there in the office. Ik it isn’t a sub 6 or lower but hopefully I can get there someday soon, my next visit im going to try and ask them for/about an insulin pump or at the very least getting a fast acting insulin pen.

If basal is sending the patient low, the correct answer is to lower the dose.

If he’s taking his total daily N dose from before and just giving that much, it’s going to be too much. N has a significant peak in action, and is usually assumed to at least help cover a meal or two in addition the basal action, especially if dosed fewer than 3-4 times/day."
Any advice from seasoned T1’s,"Diagnosis changed from T2 to T1 this Tuesday. First dose of basal Weds evening. Current plan is 8 units each morning, nothing else. Routine changed from 1000 metaformin and 40 Gliclazide both AM and PM.

Before lunch
Before evening meal
Before bed.

In the 4 days I have been injecting insulin my waking results have gone from consistent 5’s to 6,7 and today 8. Before evening meals gone from 5’s to 6’s. 

It seems like my blood glucose is higher on insulin than it was on the tablets. Is this normal? Is this a period of change and my body just needs time to adjust or does it mean my 8 units are not sufficient? I don’t have an appointment for another 10 days to discuss with the diabetic nurse, but I don’t want to undo all the progress I have made the May month getting down from the 16’s to the 5&6’s.

Thank you to anyone that can offer any insight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14nqgh6/any_advice_from_seasoned_t1s/,"There’s probably a couple of things at play here:

1. (Most likely the biggest factor) is that the oral meds are wearing off and leaving your system, resulting in reduced insulin sensitivity. 

2. The autoimmune response casing the T1D hasn’t stopped- it’s still ongoing, killing off more and more of the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Assuming the overall diabetes onset (not the re-diagnosis) is recent, you probably have a significant amount of those cells providing extra natural insulin. Over time, that natural (doctors will use the term “endogenous” meaning “from within the body”) insulin production will basically fall to zero, and you’ll need to inject more to maintain the same blood sugar levels. 

The process described in (2.) is far from immediate, and it’s unlikely that all of the cells will ever be completely killed off, but the ones that remain will basically go dormant once the mass falls below a certain threshold. 

This is definitely a “talk to your doctor” situation, but I would at least ask them if they are comfortable with you adjusting your doses (in small increments) as needed to maintain optimal sugar levels. They may want you to have some additional education first, but most physicians are willing to allow (not sure how they’d stop you anyway) patients to self-adjust doses as needed. 

Insulin is a hormone- not a traditional medication, and needs can and will fluctuate. Monthly cycles will definitely have an impact. Your needs will vary depending on the time of the month, what you ate yesterday, how much you exercise, and a whole host of other factors. Learning to roll with the punches and adapt as needed is important."
Any advice from seasoned T1’s,"Diagnosis changed from T2 to T1 this Tuesday. First dose of basal Weds evening. Current plan is 8 units each morning, nothing else. Routine changed from 1000 metaformin and 40 Gliclazide both AM and PM.

In the 4 days I have been injecting insulin my waking results have gone from consistent 5’s to 6,7 and today 8. Before evening meals gone from 5’s to 6’s. 

It seems like my blood glucose is higher on insulin than it was on the tablets. Is this normal? Is this a period of change and my body just needs time to adjust or does it mean my 8 units are not sufficient? I don’t have an appointment for another 10 days to discuss with the diabetic nurse, but I don’t want to undo all the progress I have made the May month getting down from the 16’s to the 5&6’s.

The only word that keeps popping into my head is “erratic”. It really seems everything to do with T1 is all over the place. I would assume that you’re correct and the medication has worn off so the numbers are rising. I guess I now have to treat each day as a new day and act accordingly rather than the less erratic take 2 pills x2 a day and job done. I don’t have a planned appt until next week so I will just keep monitoring the numbers and tell the nurse then and see what she advises.

Find a new doctor: I don’t care how much you like him he’s got a shitty clerical staff and has no reason to actually care that they suck. I find that it’s best to find an in-network establishment that does diabetes management but functions also as a primary care. Somewhere that has multiple doctors who are available weekly. Bonus points if they have an on premise lab for blood work so you don’t have to go anywhere separate for an A1C. Most importantly call them and see how easy it is to make an appointment and how competent the desk staff is. If they’re so booked that you have to wait a month or more for an appointment they’re no doubt busy enough to forget about your file after you leave. If the office staff is garbage they will slow the processing of paperwork and delay they things you need outside the office. 

Find a new pharmacy: The problem could also be the pharmacy having stricter rules on prior authorization and the max full amount on your particular scripts. If you think that’s a possibility stop using that pharmacy. Have the script transferred or tell your doc to send a new one. I prefer to use a mail order pharmacy because sometimes the reason that pharmacy’s are slowing getting your script filled is the sheer volume of transactions they encounter. So if you do choose to get it at a pharmacy location pick one that’s not the most popular of the brands chain in your area. I don’t know if any docs really do it anymore but you can also maybe ask your doctor to give you a written script to take to the pharmacy yourself. 

Worst case scenario you can actually buy insulin over the counter at Walmart. It’s like $25 for a vial and it’s not rapid acting but it will get you by if you bolus early and spread out carb intake. Obviously it’s not what you want to have to do but it’s better than going completely without insulin

I had struggled with disbulimia about a year after my diagnosis. I was 13. Had just moved to a new state. New school. I was on an insulin pump that caused way too much attention. It started off by me just not wearing my pump at school. To not wearing it ever. New endo found all this out and asked me if I wanted to try lantus and humalog. Started those but was never consistent. And after I realized I could not take my shots and eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted and still lose weight?!?! It was a wrap. The constant fatigue didn’t matter. The constant thirst. Constantly peeing. The threats from my mom and doctors to put me into the eating disorder clinic. I didn’t care. I just wanted to be “skinny”. I’d take care of myself for a few months to get people off my back and then fall right back into it. It was so hard to get out of that “I don’t care as long as I’m skinny” mindset after having it for 10+ years. Thing is…. the only thing that made me change was ME wanting to change. Not one person around me could convince me to do so.

I’m still working on my relationship with food and diabetes, but my last A1C was a 6.8 and I have my curves again! The main things that have helped me the most are:
1. Our T1 reddit page. It helped me not feel so isolated and alone with my problems. 
2. Counseling
3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (it helped me change my attitude and thoughts towards diabetes and food)
4. CGM + Tslim pump combo. The injection site isn’t the most fun but I love that once it’s in it’s easy to bolus. I do my pump boluses from my phone app so it doesn’t feel nearly as intrusive.

There’s also a recovery center that specializes in diabulimia in Utah.

Before my dx I was a normal eater, never cared about portion sizes, feeling full, blah blah blah. Then I started insulin and I just started eating everything. Early in my dx I was mistaken as a t2 because I was 22. So I was told to restrict carbs and suddenly food became good and bad. Eventually I was put on insulin and this gave me free reign to finally eat all the “bad” foods I had been swearing off because I felt like I had control. And also I went to “fuck it” mode. After that the fitness fad rolled around and I was here for it. I became an athlete, portioned food out, meal planned, ate healthy and all the things. Then I got divorced, then Covid (I’m a healthcare worker) and everything went out the window.. dopamine was scarce and food became an addiction for me. So here I am. Overweight, not to an extreme, but enough that I am utterly disappointed in how I’ve treated my body. If one day we could eat like dogs and have a rationed amount of kibble day that required no obsession or calculating, or contemplating the effects, I’d sign up in a heart beat. I hate food."

Today I was mowing the lawn and not keeping an eye on my levels. He went and laid down right in front of the lawn mower and wouldn't move.

The cost for the dog makes it a fever dream for me but just curious on anyone’s thoughts or knowledge on them 🤷🏼‍♀️,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14nlhsy/alert_dog/,Can you tell me where you got yours from? Does your daughter love the extra companion/security of having the dog always? Do you take them everywhere like shopping/restaurants etc?

Will Dexcom or Omnipod send free sensors/pods in case of occlusion or poor adhesive?,I'm new to the omnipod 5 system and have been a user of the original Omnipod for almost 10 years now. I built up extra pods over that time but there isn't a way to do that with Dexcom sensors.,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14nmw16/will_dexcom_or_omnipod_send_free_sensorspods_in/,"Dexcom are pretty good at sending replacements for failed sensors, whether that be the sensor itself being faulty, the adhesive coming off, I've had them replace mine because I knocked it loose bashing into something at work, too. I was able to build up spares by reporting them as soon as they failed. Assuming you are regularly prescribed them and your prescriptions always come on time, when you report a failed sensor you should get a few days extra 'free' because of the time the sensor was already on before it failed"

Re: building a back up Deccom (G6 but not G7) you can restart the sensors. Ive got a 9 months backlog of sensors cause i usually restart and get 15 days. Tons of videos on YouTube on gow to restart. Omnipod is just three days no way to build in a backup haul."

No easy way to do it for Dexcom other than using them longer than 10 days as someone mentioned.

Both companies have replaced devices for me every single time I call to report an issue or failure, whether it’s the adhesive or a malfunction."

For Dexcom, you might also consider wearing one of the over patches.

Where to put CGM when you have a baby/kids to carry?,"I recently started using a Dexcom G6 and as I have a 7 month old baby who I need to carry around, I have been wearing it on the back of my right arm. I find if I hold my baby with my left arm only he does not fiddle and pull it off. His legs will knock it off if I put it on my belly. My right arm is looking bruised and getting quite sore from repeated use now though. I sleep on my left side so don’t want to switch the CGM to the left arm. 

Where are some other baby-friendly CGM insertion sites? I was thinking maybe my hip on the side I don’t hold baby, perhaps?

Have you been hungrier since your diagnosis?,I have been noticing an overeating pattern and an overall hungry-all-the-time version of myself. How can I solve this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14nf91n/have_you_been_hungrier_since_your_diagnosis/,"One of the hormones hit along with insulin is amylin which is a hormone that helps control appetite. there is an injectable form of it called symlin but it's not done as a basal type injection and is currently only done before meals which all it did for me was mess with insulin sensitivity for meals that way.  

BUT if I threw it in a spare omnipod at an amount comparable to 3x meal doses spread out over 24hrs, my crazy hunger disappeared. 

It wasn't helpful as prescribed/intended, it helped with meal spikes, but it was another 3x injections, and if they made it as a basal type injection it would probably help more with the constant background hunger(as tested with it in an omnipod). Small study of it's use in a pump(I wasn't aware of this study and tested it on my own, oops):  https://www.endocrinepractice.org/article/S1530-891X(20)41556-3/pdf


I hit 240lb and asked about glp1s, my Dr said my insurance keeps denying them for off label use as a t1, so I asked for wegovy because it was the same as ozempic and I qualified for it's obesity label now, so they put in for that and it was approved. 
 The hunger for me calmed down at the 1.0 and 1.7 doses, but I'm noticing the hunger is still there but is at least somewhat ignorable and my weight has stabilized for a few weeks around 205. It's not without side effects, and has become harder to get at doses from .25-1.0

Going low carb also helps reduce appetite/hunger by manipulating some of the signals that regulate appetite,

Didn’t we already know this?,,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-66054946,"I mean I agree with the conclusion that covid can cause t1d but, my issue with the BBC aside, illness of any kind has been shown to trigger t1d in some ppl so is it possible that covid itself isn't excessively causing t1d but bc it was such a sudden and overwhelming virus with an extremely high infection rate it appears to cause more cases of t1d. 

Not so good at explain but in general a comparison between percentage of t1d diagnoses following other illnesses and covid and t1d diagnosis. So it's compared as X/covid cases got t1d and X/pneumonia (for example) cases got t1d. 

Also the BBC report it as if they just used the amount of ppl diagnosed in the pandemic regardless of covid status. I was diagnosed in 2021 due to pneumonia but never had covid do I count? (Ik the actual research won't count others like me)"

Didn’t we already know this?,,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-66054946,"While any coverage of this study will certainly never cover all that the study has included, I think BBC did a pretty good job. 
I myself was diagnosed in 78 after my first go round of chicken pox.  So yes there has been causation found between Illness as a precursor to t1.  But the interesting link between t1 and Covid was theorized really early in the pandemic and while yes Covid is higher on the charts as far as it being contagious the more fascinating part to this is the rate at which Covid is turning out t1s.  We as a group are pretty stable generally at 3% of the world population. Year after year it’s been 3%. There have been other similar contagious viruses such as measles but despite its ranking high on cases(prior to vaccination availability) did not increase the numbers of t1s.  We still remained about 3%.  So with this kind of increase you have to ask, what specifically about Covid is causing the autoimmune response that is a function of our crappy disease? Once Covid becomes more endemic like the flu will we still see the increase in new diagnoses?  I’m certainly not smart enough to answer this but I’m definitely interested in finding out."

Child Diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes,"Hello all,

Any recommendations are welcome, including advice on other aspects and things I likely haven't even thought of yet. 

This is all new, and terrifying, but I am doing my best to set them up for success so they can try to live their life as normally as possible. Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14n7qvj/child_diagnosed_with_type_1_diabetes/,"Hey, I’ve got an entire  booklet of information on T1D if you’d like to read it. It’s basically all the information I wanted to have at diagnosis but didn’t have access to an endocrinologist/diabetes team to ask questions so I researched my own. I’m happy to send you a copy.

….

For your specific question, I use Carbs&Cals. Not the 35£ a year one you have to pay for, it cost £5 at first use and then it’s the basic package versuion. I’ve also got the book version (same name) in case my phone ever fails or whatever. 

Its not the best app ever (because it’s the basic app, some brand name options are locked. Take Nutella, on the app the actual Nutella is locked, but it does offer alternatives- in this case “chocolate hazelnut spread”) but it’s decent and does the job well enough. 

I’ve heard Calorie King and MyFitnessPal are good. No personal experience.

…

General tips: 

There are 42 known factors that affect how insulin reacts and responds to your blood sugar levels. We can account for only some of those- as such sometimes diabetes does really weird stuff and sometimes there is no pattern. 

https://diatribe.org/42-factors-affect-blood-glucose-surprising-update

…

Diabetes is a marathon not a sprint. There are good days and bad days and sometimes everything will go to pot and nothing will make sense. And that’s okay. Go to sleep, get back up and start the day off fresh the following day. 

…

It’s ok not to be ok (that’s for you as well, T1D parent) Dealing with a chronic illness is hard, supporting someone with a chronic illness is hard. Remember to cut yourself some slack. It’s ok not to be in range all the time, it happens. Just fix it, make a note of it and move on. 

…

And this is probably the most important: your numbers for blood sugar are not good or bad. It’s data. That’s all- just data to inform you of your next move. Don’t fall into the trap of good or bad, that only leads to stressing out over numbers (stress responses in the body also release cortisol and adrenaline which only increase your insulin resistance leading to higher blood sugar levels) and eventually burnout. You fix it, you note it down and you move on.

Finally, document everything. If you eat carbs and dose for it, you write it down. Write blood sugars down before each meal and bedtime, if you can also get ones approx two hours after you finish eating as well (it gives the doctors ideas on dialing in your short acting insulin to carb ratios)"

It’s a lot. Our 11 year old son was diagnosed last August and we are still adapting. It isn’t easy but it’s manageable and there are so many tools available today that weren’t even just a few years ago.

We got him an iPhone immediately after the diagnosis and it was a big help.

Read and learn as much as you can. That will give you confidence. It’s all trial and error and it’s as much art as science so try not to get frustrated when things don’t work like you expect.

The Dexcom CGM was a big upgrade for us and we recently also got the Omnipod 5. Things have improved so much for us and our son with this new set up.

This is a wonderful and supportive community, take full advantage and don’t be shy with question!

As an aside, I am learning how to make apps as a hobby and am preparing to publish my first on on the Apple App Store. It’s an calculator for figuring proper insulin dosage for Bolus and corrections 🙌🏻

Know that you’re not alone. You have support. You can do this. Your child will thrive with your love and support."

I intend on getting them a phone so they can install the app themselves and get in the habit of tracking throughout the day, but the only app I've tried so far is Carb Manager and I'm not liking it. Any recommendations are welcome, including advice on other aspects and things I likely haven't even thought of yet.

First time traveling as a diabetic. Please share how airport security works,Specifically how does bringing needles and so on work.

I don't ever bring a doctor's note. They aren't really supposed to be allowed to ask what it is for or anything, but I am transparent. I say I am a type 1 diabetic and these are my medical supplies if asked. I have never had a problem. Basically, you put all your supplies together in a clear plastic bag (I usually do a 1 gallon ziploc freezer bag), take it out of your backpack or purse or whatever the larger bag your carrying it in, put it in one of those tray thingies. Just be transparent and don't need to act like you are hiding anything. They usually don't ask."

I used to get a doctor's letter, but I don't do that anymore. The only time I ever got in trouble was right after 9/11 I mistakenly brought some scissors (back then I had to cut out my own over patches). I was in high school and just didn't think about it. 

I also used to put my pump in a bin through the x-ray machine, but I also quit doing that. I haven't had much problem outside of having to say ""it's a medical device that is attached to me""."

I don't have a pump but I switched from injecting tresiba in my thigh and do it in my stomach and that has had a big picture effect. What also worked was changing what time I took it, NOT saying this is what you should but perhaps it's worth a conversation with your doctor or worth a thought. Lastly I changed my eating habits a little and have to approach evening snacking or late dinner a little differently so there's nothing there to sneak attack me while I'm sleeping. I've always been good with my meals and nutrition so I wasn't necessarily eating wrong but I changed my food distribution throughout the day. I too had issues my my bg during night and for my doctor it wasn't about changing insulin again but finding ""my rhythm"" using them. 

If it doesn't improve talk to your Dr, sometimes things don't make sense even if they should and then there's alternatives. I hope something will help because I remember how heavy I felt waking up after a high night."

Did you bolus for the chicken Caesar? I’m assuming there were croutons, do you bolus for protein? Was it a carb approximation or did you measure (weigh?) the food? Was it a prebolus, or did you take insulin at time of beginning to eat?

What was you “low” number at 11? Was this a cgm reading or finger stick?

treating DKA at home?,"hi friends, I was diagnosed at age 4 and started on a pump at 6. I remember every now and then I’d get sick and my mom called it ketones and I’d stay home from school for a day, take corrections til my BG was down and drink lots of water til the ketones cleared and I stopped throwing up. In high school, I developed an allergy to the pump adhesives and often ripped them out in my sleep, so I was sick with ketones a lot, like once a month. Every time, I stayed home for a day, brought BG down, and drank ungodly amounts of water til i felt better. I thought nothing of this except that it was annoying so I switched to MDI and haven’t developed ketones since then.

When my brother was in the ICU in DKA, I kind of put 2 and 2 together and realized that what my mom was calling ketones was quite literally DKA. I always was scared of DKA and thought it was like ketones but 1000x worse, but now I see I was in DKA all of those times and didn’t know it. I know now that DKA is very serious and requires a hospital visit, but I’m wondering is it really so dangerous to treat at home by taking corrections and drinking water?

1) CGM alerts waking up a partner in the middle of the night.  And they can't get back to sleep (I usually just sleep through them...).  Solution: Get the hell off of any Guardian 3 Medtronic sensors - they suck.  If you're on a Dex that's connected to your phone, connect the phone to headphones overnight.  The alarms will only ring in the headphones and you'll both sleep just fine /s.    
2) The supid shit that I've said when I was low.  Solution: Get good therapy so that it doesn't come spilling out when you run low.  It works!  I'm actually engaged now.    
3) Hypoglycemia-induced ED.  The stress hormone flood that you get when you're low isn't conducive to erections and it makes it more (incredibly?) difficult for women to have orgasms - or so I've been told.  Solution:  Keep an eye on where your blood sugar is trending if sex might be on the agenda.  

The good news:    
It will go a LONG way in helping you sort out shit partners that you shouldn't be considering in the first place.  If they don't make an effort to understand what you're going through, another one will be coming along soon.  Your person is out there."

My general advice is mention it casually or just bolus in front of your date and when he asks what you’re doing say, “Oh, have I not mentioned I’m diabetic?” Like, bring it up like it’s no big deal. Sometimes I think people roll it out like, “Listen, there’s something kind of important I haven’t told you yet, and… I hope you still want to date me after you hear this… but… I’m diabetic.” Then it ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you say it like it’s not a big deal to you, it won’t be a big deal to him. If you say it like you’re telling him you have terminal cancer, he’s going to think it’s a big deal and maybe he will have second thoughts."

If they’re not willing to stick by you through the highs and lows (lolz), they’re not worth dating.  Diabetes is and always will be a huge part of your life.  It’s not everything that makes you “you”, but it is going to be involved in everything you do.  If you ever lapse in managing, you need a partner who will look out for you.

I’ll be honest that I didn’t entirely know what I signed up for with my husband when we were young and dumb and first dating.  I knew very little about diabetes at the time, and he was haphazardly managing it on his own uninsured in the before Obamacare days.  Even with insurance he’s still not great at managing, and we don’t really have enough money for him to use a pump or CGM with any consistency.  Poor guy has spent the last few years since Covid job hopping and changing insurance plans too much to ever meet the deductible and out of pocket so he can get a new pump (Thanks, Tandem, for abandoning the t:Flex).  He needs me to be the nagging wife that’s constantly asking, “Have you checked your blood sugar?” but he also hates when I nag lol.

Anyway, if and when you find the right person, just be careful you maintain an equal partnership and don’t fall into parent-childlike stuff.  Caregiver burnout is real, and T1D can slowly burn up a good partner.  And definitely consider very carefully before having children with someone because your kids will have to learn to have a diabetic parent too."

Diabetes is a way bigger deal to us than it is for the people in our lives. It's all about perspective. Out perspective is from the one dealing with it, and for the 2 of us at least it's been most of our lives. We organize our time around it, we make decisions on what and when to eat because of it. And we never get a day off. It's always in the back of our minds,nif not the forefront at all times. Hell the first thing I do when waking up from a dead sleep is check my dexcom. Its on my mind before I'm even fully awake. It's become almost autopilot at this point. That's how we see it. And so it makes sense that it is this huge piece of baggage to us. 

Now your partner is gonna care, hopefully, but they're not gonna have it on their mind at all times. My wife knows enough for emergency situations but aside from that, i take care of everything myself. She doesn't have to think about it 24/7 like i do. So outside of times when I'm changing pods or sensors, having a low, or taking a bolus it's out of her mind. I think most non diabetics will be similar when in a relationship with a diabetic. 

Lemme put it another way that might help. Do you personally think it would be harder to date someone with let's say Epilepsy?  Just like most diabetics I know, a lot of epileptics have learned what triggers them and what they can and can't do. So if you were to date someone with it, who has it mostly under control, would it be hard for you to get past? Would it be too much worry for you? The answer is gonna be different for everyone."

Maybe not the type of answer you were looking for but that's been my experience. It's been a struggle. :/

Edit: okay, just read the other comments. I think my problem with it interfering with dating and friendships in general was that for me it IS a a big deal. For me, it wasn't something I grew up with, so the diagnosis turned my life upside down, and I haven't recovered from that. So that has played into my relationships.

As I've always been open with my T1D, no one ever said anything negative. :)
When I first met my boyfriend we started to talk pretty fast and the first things we knew about each other were that I'd just dumped my ex and had T1D and he had been left by his wife for another guy and had to deal with burnout & depression and care for 5 dogs (4 of them hers).

Long story short, we both didn't see each other's diseases as burdens, we just handled them, right from the beginning. He knew what to do in case of a glucose emergency right away and I knew what to do when he laid on the couch and couldn't do anything. Worked pretty well for almost 5 years now. :)

My advice: have an open talk with your partner (talk open in general, be it about diseases or feelings or that stupid coworker who doesn't get anything, whatever) - it works best if both partners want their partner to be happy. :)
Sorry for the long post. Tried to keep it short, though. ^^'
Edit: He WILL ""deal with everything"" bc you are important to him; or the problem is his and not yours and your diabetes is not the reason he breaks up but his weakness is. The way I see it. <3"

It was not pretty. He knew about my diabetes, and he definitely had a learning curve regarding the ins-and-outs of my diabetes (like if I’m super low get me some juice- not a big ol’ orange I have to try to chew 😂). He stuck around and we’ll be celebrating 30 years of marriage this September. The point I’m trying to make is that there are people out there who will see you as a whole person, not just a disease- those are the ones who will have your back. You’ve got this, and I’m confident you will find the person who will accept you in your entirety- insulin bottles and all!🙂"

I didn’t find that it caused any problems in our lives. 

I did find when she’s high she gets moody and if we are having an argument it’s best that I don’t stop her and ask her what her sugar is. Found that out the hard way. 

Now our son was recently diagnosed and she’s explaining it in even more detail. Just be open and clear you’ll find someone who supports you."

The man I'm currently dating now is the first to not have any knowledge of diabetes prior to dating me (the others had diabetic relatives and one was diabetic himself) and never once did it pose an issue. 

He's learned about what diabetes is, what to do in case something happens to me, lately he learned what my glucose readings mean and he'll point out if I'm low or high. That's a good relationship, he didn't care about the illness and he did his best to learn what it entails and what to do in different situations. 

I also belive that to be the minimum requirement for partners of diabetics. If your partner or potential partner has an issue with it, or is unwilling to learn then in my humble opinion the relationship just can't work out. Also be straight up with your potential partners about diabetes. It's not something to be ashamed of and it's a pretty important information about you."

If your partner doesn't want to be with you because of that, you are better off without them. It is easy to say, but I have been there, and it could have been very ugly. Telling your troubles is better than letting them deal with it with no information.

unfortunately or fortunately, if you’re deemed conventionally attractive enough, men are very physical/visual creatures so they will happily ignore other things about you for better or for worse. im not the hottest person in the world but people always find me very “cute” so i think that combined with the diabetes, make men become very protective of me and tend to worry about me and my blood sugar and try to take care of me. 

and despite my good experiences, when i found out my guy friend from high school was in a long term relationship with a girl who has type 1, i asked him a few questions about what pump, cgm she uses etc., and he was completely clueless. didn’t know a single thing about her diabetes. i was pretty shocked. turns out he was cheating on her the whole time. he’s a shitty guy when it comes to relationships. so, it seems the fact that he was clueless about her diabetes was a red flag about his overall character!"

I knew absolutely nothing about diabetes when I was diagnosed.  I know they talked to me about what range my BG should be in.  It was 1987 and meters were available but I don’t know how much they were used as they were very fussy to use, strips were insanely expensive and not too easy to find.

I had one appointment with the endo after I was discharged.  I had already decided I was going to think about diabetes as little as possible and when she told me they had a blood test tha.t would tell them how my control was over the previous 3 months I was worried, because I was writing fake numbers in my log book and not actually checking my BG.  They didn’t end up drawing blood at that appointment, my temporary Medicaid ran out and I didn’t see a doctor again for the next 11 years."

I was immediately admitted with fluid and insulin and started going to the high-risk clinic a month later. He was born a preemie at 33w4d and weighed a whopping 8lbs 14oz. (Obviously) Control was so much harder during pregnancy for me. Back then, we still used vials of NPH, R, Novo... not a ton of choices. Def not the flexibility and control I have on the pump now. The pump has been magic for me. I was at a 9 (2021) before I started it, and after the first 6 months, my a1c was down to 6.7 and is still getting better, 3 years later.

Until then, I didn't even know I was a diabetic.  I was constantly thirsty and going to the bathroom a lot a few months before I was hospitalized.  My grandma, however, suspected that I was coming down with this disease because she had a couple of relatives that also had it.  Since it ran in the family, I was the next victim of it."

I didn't get one at diagnosis (Oct 1990), but I remember a goal of 7-7.5 starting right away. They had no reason to run one at diagnosis as most people were diagnosed in DKA, and even those of us lucky enough to have been caught quickly (my mom recognized the symptoms from her brother's diagnosis about 25 years earlier and asked my doctor to have me checked - I was his first diabetic (he was an amazing doctor who had been practicing 20+ years, but T1 was a lot rarer condition back then) - it could have taken me getting very ill if not for my family history) had super high sugars (mine was over 600 after lunch and in the 500s when checked into the hospital after dinner). There was no good reason to do an A1c to diagnose; it was a measure of success in treatment.

To answer my own question, A1c testing was first possible in 1955, but they didn't realize that diabetic patients had elevated A1c until 1968. It was proposed to use it to monitor diabetic patients' control in 1976, and some sort of standardization took place in the 1990s. One article I read said Alc testing was not adopted into ADA (American Diabetes Association) guidelines until after 2009. By that time it had been a standard of care on the west coast (California, Oregon, and Washington) for years as I have been getting A1c done since the early 1990s through both different doctors and insurance providers. My brother (T1 since 2001) had also been getting A1c since diagnosis."

Neuropathy, gastroparesis, kidney disease/ damage, starting to see retinopathy (which is normal after almost 30 years and I'm so grateful it's not worse than it is) and more. 

One thing I'm not sure of is if my diabetes played any role in my thyroid going ham. I had an overactive thyroid that got problematic in 07. Had a scan and uptake, and it was 12x faster than it should've been. They said Graves disease. Then, about 12 years later, I started putting on weight and learned that my thyroid burnt itself out, essentially, so now I'm hypo instead of hyper. Because it's endocrine related, I always wondered if T1/ existing endocrine crap had anything to do with it. I'll have to remember to ask my Dr. I've had millions of chances but always get sidetracked with the T1 stuff. Anyone else have a thyroid that also went haywire after the T1 diagnosis?"

Not to mention, my mom was all about her and her life during my dx that she didn't... care? I'm not sure it's the best word, but it's what I've always felt. She didn't learn about it, didn't stay on me about it, didn't change our/my eating habits... she didn't help me help myself, etc. I think because she didn't treat it with the seriousness it deserved, in turn, neither did I. (At first). Definitely ask your Dr to check all your T's (they'll know exactly what you mean just by that) and express concern about your thyroid. If they test them all, you should have your initial answer when the bloodwork comes back. Treatment during the time my thyroid was overactive was methimazole to slow the thyroid and a beta blocker to slow my heartbeat. (Resting was over 140). I was on it for about 12mos +/- , then able to be weaned off. My thyroid still kept me really thin, and I had a few other small symptoms/issues but lived for 10 years as a hyper that didn't require meds. Somehow. Then it burnt itself out, and I knew something was up for the sheer fact that I could gain weight since I couldn't prior. Went to my endo, tested all the T's, so now I'm hypo, and on levythyroxine. I dropped the pounds I gained, and I'm feeling pretty good. T's all in normal range. As much as our endocrine system sucks, it was pretty easy to treat and manage, compared to T1, that's for sure.  Nothing my body does surprises me anymore. I'm wishing you the best of luck, and I hope your worries are unfounded. We already deal with enough=/

Being able to say I'm not the only one has given a me alot of strength. This sub and everyone active on it has been immensely helpful. I make comments on here for some things but lurk mostly. (I'm old lol) I have been in a position to help people that need pens or something else that I might have a big stockpile of. (I will still offer if I see someone struggling and in need. I'm on a pump now but still get pens and stuff as backup that I don't always use or even open. They end up expiring, so I'm happy to give them to someone who will use them before that happens. Allowing it to expire and tossing it gives me the same anxiety feeling we get when we know we don't have much insulin left)
I've cheered many of you on from afar and am proud of others accomplishments and success stories. Learning about everyone else's experiences, ups and downs and then the literal ups and downs lol, comparing notes and advice has all been so beneficial to me. The wealth of knowledge-- technical and medical info-- some of y'all are fr actual geniuses! I just couldn't ask for a better community of people. Period."

Some folks on here have parents who have it and they could be shown the ropes a bit. Or grew up maybe knowing about it more. Seems we both went in blind! My mom was also the same way, maybe not that she didn’t care… but also wasn’t super involved. Which I mean i can’t fault her entirely for. I was 12. I mean she came to all my appointments. And carb counted everything in the beginning. Always made sure I had all my supplies. But she wasn’t super educated on it beyond what the doctors would tell us both at appointments. I didn’t want her babying me when it came to it. So she definitely backed off at a certain point. I think how you said for your mom, that she didn’t treat it with the seriousness that comes with it, I think that most definitely sculpted my outlook on it as well! So nice to know I wasn’t the only one brought up like this Omg 🥲 
And yessss my next appointment is in August. I’m supposed to get blood work done anyways so maybe I can just call and see if they add those orders for the thyroid onto it and I can get everything checked. As much as I don’t wanna know if there’s another issue. It might be the answer to some of the things I’ve been experiencing. The weight gain being the most prominent. 😒 my attitude towards my health is avoidant as all hell so…. I’m trying to work on that. 
Likewise, this thread has made me feel “normal” 
I appreciate the community so much. I was a lurker until I finally made an account a few months ago and was able to follow more closely and comment. It’s helped. Like a little form of therapy for me lol 🥹"

Dexcom placement,"I am wanting to expand where I place my dexcom but I’m so nervous of compression lows. I have used my upper arms front and back, and my stomach once. When I used my lower stomach is gave me weird lows occasionally. 

I am wanting to try my lower back and was wondering if you ever get compression lows there. I primarily sleep on my side and stomach so I’m not nervous about sleeping but more like just sitting.

I've been doing it for years now.

The desire to rotate sites is understandable, however, I don't think it's as needed as for infusion sites. The scarring from the sensor is pretty minute. We also don't have to worry about absorption here.

Do you find particular problems with using your arms?

As an aside, I place mine on the front of my arms as a strategy to prevent compression lows. I find that while I have noticed the effect from lying or even just pushing down on the sensor, I've also found a similar effect when I simply change positions when I'm lying down - even if the sensor isn't compressed at all."

My personal preference is your upper thigh, placed sideways, it sounds odd but gives me amazing accuracy and I avoid compression lows due to it - all be it I don’t sleep on my stomach. A really odd spot I’ve never tried but have seen other people try is your calf, on the back of your lower leg where the fat is and it seems like it may be a good spot but easy to rip off

The person I posed the question to confirmed that they are indeed puncturing their skin four times every day to deliver 20u of basal insulin. 

Asking clarifying questions, vs jumping to conclusions, to determine the same words are equal in each person’s vocab is a great modus operandi. We each deal with this disease in very different ways; to assume my way of managing the disease is equal to anyone in this sub would be ignorant of me (ie it’s absolutely wild to me that someone would inject basal 4 separate times, thus my clarification question. I’m very glad it works for this person, I personally would never ever; splitting a lantus dose was not a thing I was willing to do (saw little benefit / sis not increase stability of sugars) and thus switched to tresiba.

"Scared of lows, it's messing me up bad.","The anxiety that low blood sugar has caused me over the past couple of months is really messing with my head and I'm messing up my numbers.

Last December I had a really bad low, chugged a coke and all I remember is waking up on the side of my bed, no memory of getting into bed or falling asleep.

Do you have a CGM?  You can set alarms at higher levels than you might normally set them.  Instead of setting a low warning at 70 you might set it at 90 or whatever.  Over time you could lower it as you become less anxious.

Maybe therapy can help with anxiety."

I am not sure how to help you but I recently received the tandem and G6 CGM and it's control IQ has drastically reduced my lows and brought me much tighter control. So if a pump and CGM combo can be attained and used I would recommend it. 

  
Also, insulin resistance is when your BGS won't go down. You would be describing insulin sensitivity and it is because there are no carbs on board so it works right now on what glucose is available."

At the end of the day it doesn’t matter whether you’re doing well or not, closed loops systems aren’t just about helping people who are struggling to achieve low hbA1cs. They eliminate dozens of decisions each day, making our lives easier and safer. Calling omnipod could help, the reps may be able to help out with the difficult situation with your endo.

If you have an omnipod dash you could always set up a diy closed loop. Personally I don’t have access to Omnipod 5 so use Loop with my Dash and g6 and absolutely love it. It’s good during the day, but GREAT at night (when there’s no estimating carbs, exercise and emotions in play)."

Does your endocrinologist specialize in T1D?  I often forget that not all endocrinologists specialize in diabetes, there are other things that endocrinologists specialize in ( I don't know what that could be or why they would 😃).

You kind of have two things here that are very very closely related; getting a pump and dealing with the anxiety you have about low blood sugars. 

For getting the pump your options are convincing your current endocrinologist to write you a script or finding someone who will.  For dealing with your current endocrinologist, I think Rho_9 's idea is very good, you set up an appointment to get the pump, not discussing the pump, but getting the pump!!!  Go into the appointment like you said, armed with all the pros of having a pump ( as was mentioned the pump manufacturer should be able to help you out with this if need be).

The other option is to find someone that would prescribe a pump for you.  What about a general practitioner or a nurse practitioner?  Are there any professors in your med school that you would be comfortable with asking for recommendations?  As someone else mentioned, Omnipod may be able to help you with finding someone to help you.  I know you have mentioned Omnipod, have you looked at any of the other pumps?  I know a lot of people also like the Dexcom/ Tandem Tslim combo.

I've been waking up around the 200's because I'm scared of going low. Ever since I started my keto diet it seems like even one unit of insulin will cause me to drop dramatically. Is this insulin resistance? 

I see my sugar dropping fast and I'm terrified it's not going to level out. I've been a diabetic for years and this new found fear of mine is really throwing me into a severe burnout that's going to lead to complications.

Any advice?

Don’t be aggressive, but be firm on what you want. Modern endocrinology supports the use of insulin pumps for treatment of type one diabetes.

Smart pumps track your insulin delivery so when you have a high with insulin on board, it will manage it (stop or accelerate flow) so you don’t have episodes like he did last December. Granted, I am in California, but I’ve actually never met my endocrinologist face-to-face. It’s always been over zoom. Your primary care doctor could also sign off on an Omni pod if you’re not getting anywhere with the endocrinologist. The team at Omni pod should know a doctor in your region. (endocrinologist or primary care) who can get you started.

It’s your life, your insurance, and your benefits. The doctor is just a guide for you to live your best life. You may choose to bring someone with you to your next appointment and ask your endocrinologist “my insurance company supports insulin pump therapy with Omni pod. Are you willing to go on record to say the best course of option for my treatment is to remain on injections and forgo all of the benefits of a smart pump?”

You also have a secondary symptoms with anxiety that are easily treated with a CGM linked with an insulin pump. It is criminal what she is doing (or she simply just doesn’t know the benefits of modern technology).

If all of that fails, reach out to the American diabetes association in your state, asking for somebody who is up-to-date on modern standards of care for type one diabetes."

Edit: I have a Dexcom G6",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mg0m5/scared_of_lows_its_messing_me_up_bad/,"How to deal with having anxiety over having low blood glucose.  You said your problem with lows, and the corresponding anxiety, started with you going on a keto diet?  Maybe go off the diet or modify it so you have more carbs ( I know that works against the idea of keto diets).  Something sticks in my mind about mood swings or being more irritable as potential side effects of keto diets ( don't trust me on this, just something I remember, don't know from where, I should find info on this before posting).  Could the keto diet be a source of your increased anxiety?

So what is your actual anxiety about your blood glucose going low?  That you are not going to treat it in time and you will go unconscious and someone then not finding you?  I think that is a concern that we all have.  Do you use your phone to follow your Dexcom readings?  If so, you should be able to link your readings to other people.  That way at least someone else knows you are having a low and can check in on you.  You have been able to handle the lows so far, there is no reason you won't be able to, especially with having your Dexcom.

I'm sorry you are dealing with this and wish you luck in dealing with this.  Keep us posted on your outcomes."

Edit: I have a Dexcom G6",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mg0m5/scared_of_lows_its_messing_me_up_bad/,"I can answer this because I've been dealing with it for the last few years. There was a point when I had severe anxiety and was having frequent panic attacks over going low, constantly checking my sugar and eating sugar at the first sign of a low. I would get in these states of derealization where I felt disconnected mentally in a strange way. I barely felt safe in my home surrounded by snacks, let alone outside. There was a few things that helped me to get to where I am now. Sometimes I still get upset over the BS, but I would say I'm mostly past all that and feeling normal again on the daily.

First, I think the biggest cause of my anxiety was due to overall poor health and lifestyle choices. I often stayed up late, I'd smoke weed which feels similar to a low in some ways, I wasn't eating healthy, wasn't exercising enough, too much sex with ejaculation that's depleting nutrients, too much screen time. All things that were wearing me down physically in addition to blood sugar swings. Diabetes is stressful, and when the body is in a poor state of health, our ability to cope with that stress isn't as good. So I started changing those bad habits, and while I'm still far from perfect, getting healthier made me a lot more resilient and able to cope with the BS of diabetes. Eating good quality veggies and meats, taking good nutritional supplements, going outside for walks even when I was extremely anxious sometimes, getting enough sleep each night, etc. all helped to improve my confidence and reduce my anxiety. 

As a side note on the keto diet, just my own opinion based on how my body works, even though I eat low carb, my body definitely still needs some amount of carbs every day. If I avoid all carbs my blood sugar goes on a roller coaster where any carbs spike me up and any insulin crashes me hard. So I need to eat with insulin regularly to keep food fueling me and create stability.

Second, like others have mentioned, going on a pump. I'm also super sensitive to insulin, especially if I've been physically active which is the main thing that affects my insulin sensitivity. The pump allows me to take much smaller doses, and I do take like 0.5 or 0.25 sometimes. I don't usually take more than 3 or so units at any time, I eat pretty low carb, and I spent a while fine tuning my diet for things that are generally easy on my blood sugar. Also the CGM is a blessing and curse, because constantly looking at the readings can definitely cause anxiety. I had diabetes for years before this anxiety about lows became such a problem, and I think constantly worrying over my CGM trends played a major part in that anxiety developing, versus things just happening without me watching all the time. So I had to learn to let things go a bit, and while that was mostly a mental and emotional thing, the tandem pump with Control IQ did help a lot particularly while sleeping overnight. As long as I don't eat right before bed, thanks to Control IQ sleep mode I basically wake up every morning around 100 since I got the pump over a year ago, and that alone is a huge relief instead of timing and adjusting the long acting insulin for overnights and not being fully sure where I'd wake up at. Knowing the amount of insulin on board is also a critical piece of info I rely on throughout the day.

Third, I honestly just had to give things time. I didn't stop being constantly afraid of lows quickly. I would say I gradually got better and more confident/ comfortable over a period of a few months to a couple years. Not saying it has to take that long, but a big part of it was just continuing to live and experiencing occasional lows and dealing with them. Remembering how they feel and convincing myself over time I can take care of them. Now I'm like I really hate lows and don't want to go low, but I don't get super anxious thinking about them or anything.

I think about my blood sugar like this, and it's not trying to convince myself or anything, its just a logical thought process based on past experience: ""Based on how much insulin I've taken recently, how much and what kind of food I've eaten recently, and what physical activity I've done recently, I have a pretty good idea of how much momentum my blood sugar could have in either direction. If I think I'm actually heading low, time for a juice box, that shits my best friend lately, boom. Usually that's good, if that's not enough, I'll get some fruit snacks / granola bar / extra carbs on board to give my body more fuel to level out from whatever insulin or activity is sending me low. If I go low, that sucks and feels like shit but now I know based on the momentum I've thought through that this shouldn't be a serious low and it will come back up, I'll be fine."" 

Hopefully that's some helpful info, and just know others like myself are going through this same exact stuff. Lots of times I feel alone out of everyone I know, but here you are going through the same stuff as me. So I feel you for sure, and feel free to reach out anytime for the support you need. Take care, blessings of light and love friend."

It lead to me having an average of 160 for a few weeks, because I was so incredibly afraid of lows. There was one time where I had given me an insulin dose of 4 units when I was high and I had to drink over a litre of juice to fight the low…and even after that I still felt extremely low and head a bs around 50 , it didn’t want to go up at all. I was alone outside and was so afraid I would randomly pass out and people might not help me fast enough. 
Also, I was just so full and didn’t feel like I could keep eating or drinking without throwing up. 

That was about over a year ago. Now I’m back to normal, and I’m not in fear when I hit a low anymore. Probably it will get better for you too with time. But I completely understand your feelings."

I found that easing out of keto and into a low carb diet helped get more stability as the carbs kept me up longer. I also experimented with having meals that required more insulin in the safety of my home with someone there who could monitor and forcing myself to wait it out unless I actually went low. Gradually I started to trust myself again but the anxiety was triggered the same way yours was. It’s slow and takes time but you have to just become reacquainted with your levels again and be kind to yourself because it is a scary condition to have to manage

Edit: I have a Dexcom G6",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mg0m5/scared_of_lows_its_messing_me_up_bad/,"It is very common for anxiety to kick in because of a low blood sugar that caused a severe event. 

I try to correct a little early. If I am at lets say 110 headed down. I will drink 1/4 (a quarter can of soda). . Remember to wait 15 to 20 minutes to see it it helped. It you need more you still have time to drink more if needed. Set your low alert to 100 or 110 it gives you enough time to catch it and correct it.  Don’t ignore the low alert when sleeping get up and correct it right away.  A lot of people take too much when they correct a low blood sugar. Most of the time it’s because they don’t catch it early enough. They start treating it when it is at an urgent low level like 55 and because it’s not coming up real quick they  just keep taking more sugar or carbs. You have to make sure you give it enough time to start working when you do take sugar or carbs to correct it, don’t Wait until it gets too low to correct do it earlier so you have time. They have insulin pumps that help stop low blood sugars. Look into getting an Omnipod 5 or a Tandem with Control IQ. They are both really good Insulin pump’s.  they both adjust Insulin off of Dexcom readings . They have automated systems that stop low blood sugars or help prevent them and they also will give insulin as needed if going up. They are not perfect but they definitely help.

One last thing. You don’t appear to be insulin resistant. If you were the insulin you were taking would not bring you down very well. It appears you have a high insulin sensitivity due to the low carb diet. Remember do not stack Insulin. Do not give insulin and then because you’re going up a little give more. Wait for the first injection of rapid acting or fast acting insulin to start working. Typically it takes an hour or longer.  If you give one unit and you go to low then cut it back to .5 and see how that goes for you."

Edit: I have a Dexcom G6",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mg0m5/scared_of_lows_its_messing_me_up_bad/,"OP I read thru the replies and this one might have what you need. The keto diet has your glycogen stores running on empty, hindering your ability to get your bg up when combined with a long acting injection. This is why lows can feel intense. Your brain and body are drawing on all its possible sources for sugar and using it up instantly, especially as you do even simple exercising.

It’s fine to do keto as a type 1, in fact it’s a really good way to eliminate high bgs if you can get it right. What you need is even less insulin though.

An omnipod 5 could solve your problem by knowing when to cut your basal insulin to 0 as it drops, which would help you build glycogen stores. You might find instant results that way if changing your diet is unsuitable. 

It’s possible endo doesn’t know you’re on keto? I’m pretty sure this is your problem and if your endo can’t tell you differently you should definitely find a new endo :) but also a nutritionist could be good to see too; they might understand your needs a bit better and help you to advocate with the endo."

"Scared of lows, it's messing me up bad.","The anxiety that low blood sugar has caused me over the past couple of months is really messing with my head and I'm messing up my numbers.

Last December I had a really bad low, chugged a coke and all I remember is waking up on the side of my bed, no memory of getting into bed or falling asleep. 

Ever since then my A1C has slowly been creeping up. From 6.2 to 6.9 and I bet if I were tested right now I'd be in the mid 7's.

I've been waking up around the 200's because I'm scared of going low. Ever since I started my keto diet it seems like even one unit of insulin will cause me to drop dramatically. Is this insulin resistance? 

I see my sugar dropping fast and I'm terrified it's not going to level out. I've been a diabetic for years and this new found fear of mine is really throwing me into a severe burnout that's going to lead to complications.

OP don’t wait until your next appt to ask for pump. Immediately send an email / written & recorded in EMR records message stating: “hi doc, here are the benefits I seek to obtain using a pump. Twice before this I have asked to be prescribed O5, but you have declined saying my a1c is fine. My quality of life is severely diminished, and my a1c has declined due to hypoglycemia, as I’ve stated to you; gives me great anxiety (I don’t want to die). Please prescribe me a pump, or explain in detail why you will not do so.” If endo continues to deny, ask PCP & find a new endo in the meantime. Ask omnipod, if you’re dead set in that, what doctors they work with in the area, or ask this sub who in your area is on O5 & who their doc is. You aren’t stuck. 

Also, eat carbs 🤷‍♀️ wasn’t the point of keto to not have a rollercoaster, and now…you have extreme anxiety & severe lows? Doesn’t sound like it’s a benefit. Instead, figure a way to strategize eating what you love. 

I’ve learned a lot from the book “Think Like a Pancreas” and [this Instagram acct](https://www.instagram.com/givemesomesugardiabetes/guide/bolus-strategies/17851425236429311/?igshid=YzcxN2Q2NzY0OA==)

I used to think eating low carb would solve all my diabetes problems, and then, similar to you, I would have lows out of nowhere, and they were terrible, unexpected, never ending lows. I’d have 15gCHO & wait. And another 15g. And another. And my sugar would not budge. Until hours later I was finally above 100…and stuck above 200+ for HOURS & HOURS. I finally found a medium carb lifestyle (30-60g/meal) is the sweet spot. And life is so much more delicious with just a tiny bit more carb 💙🫶🏼"

Edit: I have a Dexcom G6",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mg0m5/scared_of_lows_its_messing_me_up_bad/,"Also a pro tip, when things are stable carbs usually hit the blood sugar faster than insulin (humalog / novolog) starts working. So in addition to the option of a prebolus, when you eat a meal eat the protein first then the carbs, the protein digests slower and acts like a buffer so the carbs don't launch your blood sugar like a rocket into space. As least not as fast which gives the insulin more time to balance things out. If I eat eggs then waffles, it's a lot easier for me to deal with than eating waffles before eggs.

Edit: I have a Dexcom G6",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mg0m5/scared_of_lows_its_messing_me_up_bad/,"I believe this is a insulin issue not glycogen store issue. Too much insulin is overwhelming the glycogen store system in this case, not the the glycogen store systems are depleted. Keto diets are very good for diabetics. But the only difference in diabetics and non-diabetics is insulin control. OPs body doesn't need as much insulin because ketones are affected by insulin much more than glucose, and glucose isn't the main source of energy their body is using since they are trying to maintain ketosis. 

OPs body would do this naturally, except their immune system had an oops and now can't regulate their insulin. Adjusting insulin ratios and basal would be the first step in the right direction. Furthermore, this would be a logical first step because OP said after using short acting insulin blood sugar drops significantly, suggesting too much insulin ""seems"" to be the driving force in the low. 

Since keto is a very specific diet and I assume OP wouldn't want to compromise the system - looking at changing insulin ratio and basal would be much more effective without changing diet or other factors.

Edit: gluconeogenisis also happens in the body and needs no glucose intake to occur. The liver can make it's own glucose using amino acids (protein) and glycerol (fatty acid). Gluconeogenisis is what happens when the glycogen stores are depleted. [check this article out](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/glycogenesis)"

You’re booking an appointment to get the pump, not to talk about getting it. At the very least a set of achievable goals you have to work on in the next month or two to ‘qualify’ (maybe getting a normal pump so you get used to basal rates, pump sites etc).

Pump companies can sometimes direct you to a ‘helpful’ endo/educator/nurse in your area - someone that’s worked with omnipod with other patients so should be willing to help you too. They may also be able to help with some key selling points to counter any stupid arguments your endo has tried before - it’s always worth asking. There are also many studies that prove pumps help with control even in people with good hbA1cs, going in with some of these may give your argument more weight.

Best of luck!"

Last appointment was great for me. I'm on all the cutting edge tech, built from source and still planning to expand my library of wearable tech.

But gut health was the main subject of my last endo appointment, and discussion of medications that may help me stay in range more consistently.

This was my first appointment with this endo. I'm an autistic adult that suffers diabetes-induced cognitive impairments, and frankly the goals of my care plan are less about a1c or even overall health and much more about staying sharp in the head.

He walked in the room and before even shaking hands, his neurodivergence was prominently on display. One hour appointments every three months, most endos can't afford that time, but we used the whole thing and had a two page visit summary about our discussions. His attention to detail was stellar, and he had no objections to me using more doctor-like words. (He didn't even twitch when I asked about drugs that may inhibit hepatic glucose secretion, my last endo was kinda shocked I knew what I was even saying.)

This was the first appointment I've had where I wasn't just telling the doctor what I wanted for my self care and hoping they said yes. It really was a two-way learning opportunity and I felt at home and well taken care of. I'm still thinking critically about his advice and considering adding an item to my diabetes care kit.

He actually insisted I set up my NightScout server for him to keep an eye on. Last endo wouldn't touch anything but Dexcom.

So there absolutely can be reason to see an endo. Having an endo at your beck and call in case of medical emergency is important, so at least have someone, even if they just sign off on your meds."

They changed it since, I think you can get either 6 or 12 months refillable script for insulin now, but for cgms you still have to go every 3 months because they need to pull your data and put it into system for you to get next round of cgms.   
I live in South Korea now, and you can't get more than 3 months, but they DO give you three months almost always, however you absolutely have to go every 3rd month because you need paper prescriptions that you need to physically take to pharmacy.

Hi,
I just found out about this sub, and I would like to know how you guys cope with this disease. I got diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 6 years ago. To be honest, I didn't care that much then. I thought I would just be injecting insulin three times a day, so what? But as time went on, things got harder. People started feeling extra pity for me, and I found myself overthinking every extra bite I wanted to have, which caused a lot of anxiety. The doctors told me back then that there was nothing to worry about and that I could continue living a normal life like other people, but that turned out to be a big lie.

My mental health is struggling as well. Recently, I went out with a couple of friends who don't know about my illness. We ended up eating lots of sweets (sometimes I can't control myself and mess up big time). There was one friend who noticed how much I was into sweets that day, and she said, ""Be careful, mate, or you'll end up having diabetes."" I replied, ""I already have it,"" and then she said, ""You mean you're in the danger zone; it's not like you're using insulin. That shit is messed up."" I said, ""Don't worry; it won't happen.""

When I was diagnosed, doctors advised my family to take me to a therapist because they thought I might struggle with accepting the fact that I was ill. I declined the suggestion, saying that I was fine. However, six years later, I realized deep down that I hadn't fully come to terms with having this disease and the reality that I must live with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mmpt1/how_you_guys_cope/,"You can eat sweets if you bolus.

Yeah it’s hard, but yes it helps. 

Finding diabetic community also helps. Do you have any opportunities to meet other T1 folks? That was the real life changer for me - I didn’t get to go to diabetes camp as a kid so I grew up thinking I was all alone and the only one who felt like this or had to deal with it…it turns out when you’re surrounded by people who deeply understand that piece of your puzzle, life is much easier, if only for a few hours/days"

I suggest you look into some of the great books, blogs and podcasts.

After reaching level 36 (years), I’m still learning and obviously the technology has also changed enormously.

If you can find an experienced counsellor in chronic diseases or even a group in your area to catch up it’s going to make a big difference.

Try to go easy on yourself and be kind to yourself.

No one gets to be a master at being a pancreas.  We all have good periods and not so good periods.

Always see the numbers as a guide to treatment.  The numbers are not your report card on how you manage being a pancreas.

When I was diagnosed in the 90's I struggled and where I was living at the time, the hospital had a ward for everything diabetes. There was a therapist there that I went to. Therapy related to a life changing diagnosis like T1 is something you should talk to a trauma therapist about. Even if it's not a chronic illness specialist, a therapist who specialises in trauma will DEFINITELY be able to help you. It's great that you are talking to a counselor but they might not be able to help you process the trauma related to the diagnosis and give you the necessary tools to use in the future. Either mention this to your counselor who should be able to recommend someone, if that isn't possible then mentioning this to you doctor who might help or seek out a trauma therapist in your area on your own. It can be costly if you can't get support through school or your doctor and if this doesn't get results then try  finding an online therapist ( I did this during the pandemic for grief support ) that will cost less and be a solution for right now so you can get started.

I tried therapy in college and the counselor wasn’t a good fit at all, then I tried twice as an adult and it was the same thing. 

Finally the pandemic came, work stress went to like 1000%, and I was reallllly REALLLLY not doing well. My husband’s company rolled out a free Telehealth therapy benefit through Tava (52 sessions for all your family members) so I decided to give it a go. I took their quiz to match me with a therapist and I was…really not sure of their match because I had said I wanted a woman therapist (I am also a woman) and my 1 match was a guy. I’ve had some really not great experiences with male medical providers so I was hesitant.

But I was also drowning, so I said “fine, this guy gets 1 fuckin’ chance and I can ditch him if it’s weird.”

Turns out? He’s kinda fuckin’ great. We’ve got very different life experiences, but we connect on a number of issues. He left Tava and opened his own practice and I followed him in to private practice. 

He doesn’t specifically have experience with chronic illness, but he has experience with trauma. Our vibe is that I can send him scientific papers on diabetes and mental health and we talk about them in session, and he asks a lot of questions about the in’s and outs. 

So that’s to say I don’t think it’s necessary that someone specializes in chronic illness necessarily, but there is a filter on Psychology Today’s therapist finder for that? I also found that doing Telehealth therapy was a game changer, not only because it opened up more providers, but because I can be comfortable in my own home. It’s like having a zoom with my smarter, calmer friend every week"

Can we please stop acting like this disease doesn’t keep us from doing things?,"This might be controversial but I don’t care. I have to let this out somehow. 

I know some of us are more easily managed than others, but this disease is considered a disability for a reason. It’s disabling. It hinders my ability to do things and sometimes keeps me from doing them altogether because it either wouldn’t be worth it due to the blood sugar problems it would cause me or I am physically unable to do it at all any more. We have to live our lives differently than other people and it does limit us sometimes.

I’m actually getting really tired of everyone acting like diabetes makes you just like everybody else except you take insulin, because it’s not true for most of us, especially those of us with hormonal influences or imbalances that interfere with it even further. God forbid you have any other cooccurring illnesses on top of the diabetes, that can make it even worse. 

No, I don’t want to be ostracized because I’m chronically ill, but I also don’t want people who don’t understand the challenges and ramifications of this disease thinking that I can do anything I want and throw caution to the wind but choose not to, or for them to think that I’m overreacting or something. Plus it makes me feel like I have to push through whatever diabetes is throwing at me to do whatever thing I wanted to do, which then makes it feel like I’m giving up if I stop/can’t do the thing and have to take care of myself.

1. We spend a ton of time making decisions that others don't.  Always needing to plan, react or deal.  Remembering carbs, entering dang numbers all day everyday. 

2. Has there truly been a time when one could eat without thinking? Hah! How is this food going to hit me?  Did I dose early enough? Is my food going to come on time? Yeah dining out is never just dining out.  Decisions made affect future health. 

3. So many freaking appointments! Yes I can just skip then.  Oh wait, if I do I might miss the retinopathy getting worse or shit my A1C could be so high that someone will tell I'm going to die

4. Just the fact we are always reminded we could die a premature death or experience life being blind or an amputee.  It is truly glorious needing this drilled in everyday .  

5. Travel through security without a small paranoia that something will go amiss. 

7. Alarms! OMG! Yes dexcom is nice and pumps can be great but those alerts just drive me nuts.  The sounds make me feel ill.  Needing to apologize to your partner because you get a low in the mid morning and dex will not shut up.  

Anyway, I see both sides.  Tonight is a night when this echos my ongoing struggle of dealing with the sheer exhaustion of dealing ""with the same shit"".  

However, we need to truck on as nobody else is going to keep us alive for ourselves. 

You're not alone.  This disease sucks.  It's sucked since the first day I've had and had to poke needles in myself. Hang in there though.  There shall be better days"

Realistically, diabetes prevents us from doing things all the time, or at the very least it makes those accomplishments much harder. 

Example: going for a run requires careful planning with my blood sugar. Whoops, you forgot glucose tablets and you’re a few miles out? Uh oh, you might die. 

Example: you have to take a proctored exam and you can’t bring anything except a calculator. Get ready to submit a medical accommodation request for glucose tablets and a pump. Whoops, low blood sugar during the exam!

Sure, both of these activities are still “possible,” but the PITA factor rises substantially. Being an imperfect human being, my tolerance for the PITA factor sometimes gets to the point where I give up. 

That being said, I really try not to use diabetes as an excuse NOT to try, just because it will be X% harder for me."

Yes pretty much everything is still possible, but things do take more planning, and are more stressful. 

I have been diabetic for 17 years, and up to the last year or so I felt like I ought to be able to do anything, and therefore felt like a failure if I found this difficult.

But it can be harder to do things spontaneously. You do need to check your blood sugar when driving and stop if you are going low. You do have crap days where you suddenly need much less insulin than you've injected yourself with, and you have to spend all day snacking to stop yourself going low. If you have an important meeting, or a job interview, you worry about going low during it. You do constantly feel like your future health depends on the decisions you make now. When you're pregnant, you constantly feel like your baby's health depends on the decisions you make now. 

All this stuff does grind people down and we should be OK admitting that. If I don't want to go for a run today because my blood sugar hss been low all day, and it would just be work to keep it at an OK level, giving in to that doesn't make me a failure, it doesn't make me a bad diabetic. It's just hard."

Diabetes education is not always spot on and many people leave after a DKA wary that this sugar stuff almost just killed them.

So it is important to share that life is not terminal here. There is not much you cannot do, but you are right, just because you can does not mean you can all the time. T1 does take away time, energy, and does supply curveballs like bent canulas, hard to explain highs, momentum stopping lows. And chronic diseases have their own stress.

So it complex, it is not like permanently losing your sight or memory, but it does mean costs and not always having the full menu of choices.

I get what you are saying. 

It reminds me of pumps/cgms. Average people, even docs smile and say how wonderful tech like pumps and cgm ""take care of everything"" then talk about screens for T1 comorbidities and how your numbers need to improve 2 minutes later."

Brain fog and just feeling straight up like crap when your BG is high is limiting!

Of course it’s true that t1d can’t stop you from doing anything, but it can make simple things 10x harder and it can be damn annoying sometimes. nothing about it is easy.

That I’m just like everybody else and diabetes is just an inconvenience. 

I didn’t fully accept that manually managing an organ 24 hours a day is not just an inconvenience until a few years ago now that I’m in my 30s. This was due to therapy and the pandemic, which made me wildly aware of my vulnerability. 

Type 1 is a deeply traumatic disease that we use all kinds of coping mechanisms to deal with. Like denial and/or dismissing it as a minor inconvenience. The more honest we are with ourselves, the better our day to day life can be. For example, setting the expectation that you can workout whenever you want is going to lead to depression and bad diabetes management 😎 (for me, at least). 

Accepting that I’m disabled has helped me better vouch for myself in the many challenges diabetes throws at us daily - e.g., not drinking (used to drink socially all the time and it wreaked havoc on my blood sugar) more than 1 drink, telling my boss my blood sugar is low and I need someone to take over meeting for 20+ minutes instead of attempting to drink juice while presenting like a crazy person, etc."

I have more issues than I care to and I try, everyday I workout, I eat as well as possible, I walk, I lift weights, but there’s pain now, there’s numbness now and I hate being scared of what’s coming next. This disease has taken a lot from me, but mainly my freedom to be spontaneous and live in the moment. I feel like a ball and chain has been a fixed around my neck and it’s permanent.

It absolutely stops you from doing things. I used to go on long hikes and camp for long periods at a time in my late teens and early twenties sometimes for upwards of 2 weeks. But now the thought of something going wrong in the middle of nowhere is terrifying. I can go day hiking and maybe camp at a campground for a day or 2 without worrying but there’s not enough Gatorade and candy in the world I could fit into a backpack with all other essential camping supplies to make me feel comfortable backpacking in the middle of nowhere for extended periods if I go low. I’m sure some people out there with T1 are still hiking the entire Appalachian Trail to prove they can do it but that dream is just dead for me.

I have other illnesses that make controlling this disease nearly impossible.  I'm chronically homebound, can't work, and I live only with my dad.

I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in December of 1991.  Up until the Autumn of 2007, I was doing fairly well.  I was out and about unless I was sick or something.  While I had bad days during that time, I had more good days.

Then, something changed in my life in 2007.  My health declined.  Things went from bad to worse.  Each year since then became worse than the previous year.  This made it much more difficult to control my diabetes.

But, when I tried explaining this to people on another post, they gave me a lot of backlash that triggered me.  In addition to other physical problems I suffer from, I also have emotional problems.  I'm also extremely sensitive and mildly autistic.  It doesn't take much negativity to trigger me and make me lose my cool.

Most people seem to think that if I could control my diabetes, I would sleep and feel better.  But, as I said above, I was doing fairly well until the Autumn of 2007 when everything changed for the worst.  I was sleeping better and feeling reasonably well before then.  Somehow, people seem to overlook that.

I gave up trying to argue with them on that other post.  I'm just going to let them think what they want.  They're never going to understand just how much I struggle with both my diabetes and my life."

I often think that if I weren't diabetic I could do anything. If they were to cure me today, I'd feel like I'm invincible. Like nothing could hurt me.

But why is it so complicated to accept that diabetes is a disability for some good reasons and a diseas that have many, many different faces. I always got a lot of questions why I have my disability card (I don't know the correct english name but I think yk what I mean) because I only have diabetes.
It's so annoying that a lot of people get treat like this whole thing is not a big deal only because the therapie we can get is so good now.

Sidenote: (Again in my case its a big deal because) I wanted to go to the police but I can't because of this, than I wanted to do another job (only my second choice but a really great thing) and now I can't do it because of another illness. And now I don't know what I really want to do because it feels like all the thing I want I can't do. It influences our life so much and yeah I think I only will repead my self."

There are risks to things that just aren’t there for non diabetic people. Having any reason you can become separated from your insulin or your supplies for low blood sugar is always a big deal to think about—or that you are vulnerable to having sudden blood sugar swings (like in scuba diving) that certainly add an element of danger that is more than those who aren’t shackled to this chronic illness.

An example of this is when I attended a concert on Tues and i wanted to bring in two juices incase of a low.

I had to explain to her how it’s life threatening, that the sugar is needed AND even showed her my CGM (i didn’t have to do this, but i was beyond heated). I’ve been to dozens of concerts and NEVER have I been so ostracized for needing to bring in a fucking juice box. She made me turn one of the juices in.

She complains every time he can't do something because he's high or low and uses shit excuses like ""if I can control my diabetes you should to, you shouldn't have to take time out of your shift to get some insulin or a snack"" she complains if he ends up in the hospital because he either can't get his blood sugar down or his ketones are super high and he's not doing good. 

Before I met him and found this group reddit all I thought was you need to avoid sugar and you'll be fine, I'm sorry for this assumption my ex had a diabetic father I think he was type one as he used the pens but I'm unsure and he didn't allow sugar in the house or he would eat it. After I met my current boyfriend, I learned how much this actually affects his life. Sometimes, it's as small as a shaky hand or a raise in temper over things that wouldn't make him angry when his blood sugar is in check to as bad as not being able to hike or push carts because his sugar is low and there's no snacks or worse case scenario he's back in the hospital."

Long answer: Because my lived experience is different than yours and my life and experience is just as valuable as yours. 

I was diagnosed at 20 mo. Had a shit childhood. Profound learning disabilities that were never addressed. Medical issues that were also not addressed until I was near death. I was told I wouldn’t make it til my 18th birthday. I attempted suicide several times. After I turned 18 I was told I wasn’t worthy or smart enough to have a college education. 

I graduated with a bachelor’s of science. I got the medical treatment I needed for my other conditions. I am 35 years old. 

I do not pretend that my diabetes doesn’t hold me back, I do not allow my diabetes to hold me back. I make adjustments to my schedule, I take frequent breaks, I go slower than if I wasn’t a diabetic, some days are great and some days are shit, I give myself grace. I don’t let diabetes keep me from doing things but I absolutely do them differently because of diabetes. 

In summary, no I will not pretend like this disease prevents me from doing things to fit your narrative and I will not ask you to say this disease doesn’t keep you from doing things because we have different lives and experiences and THAT IS OKAY."

So, if I interpret you right, we should stop saying what our lived experiences are? Is that right? Because only doom and gloom is allowed?

Is that about the gist of that?

Newly diagnosed people come here; so too do parents of newly diagnosed kids. They deserve to be able to know both sides of the equation - that yes, it can be tough; but equally, it's possible to have a rich, fulfilling life in which T1 is something to be navigated and not be considered debilitating. My perspective is just as valid, and worthy of being posted, as yours.

>God forbid you have any other cooccurring illnesses on top of the diabetes, that can make it even worse.

I do. I have a TBI, which is infinitely worse than my T1 in how it affects my day-to-day functioning and relationships at home.

I've never claimed it's easy for everyone, or made sweeping statements about it. I've answered questions about my experiences with it, and I'll be goddamned if you're going to shut me up."

I missed a month of 8th grade, I couldn’t walk, I ran fevers so high my vision blurred out. When I got back to school, I collapsed on the stairs on the way to the library and had to be picked up by my teacher. Before the pneumonia, I swam competitively year-round, biked, ran. I wanted to do a triathlon with my best friend. After pneumonia, I had severe asthma from scarring to my lungs. Swimming was too much for me. I couldn’t run. 

A little less than a year later, I’m diagnosed with T1D after feeling my body slowly die for a month. The asthma sucked, the diabetes was fine as long as I had insulin on board and a plan. Diabetes never really slowed me down at all. I went to college, I lived abroad, I learned to scuba dive, I rode roller coasters daily for a year (not just the metaphorical blood sugar ones). Diabetes absolutely augments my every day life, but it has never taken away something I loved the way pneumonia did. 

I realize this may not always be the case. I could develop more severe complications, though nothing indicates that yet at 30. I had a dear friend that was a double amputee from T1D and man if he wasn’t the most able doer I knew. Perspective makes a big difference. If you feel held back, talk to your doctor or CDE. You may be able to change some things to better suit your life. You control your treatment and your disease, not the other way around. Therapy also makes a huge difference. I don’t see my therapist for anything diabetes-related, but it’s still something that comes up. It influences my mental health from time to time, and my care isn’t as proficient when I’m depressed or overly anxious."

I used to be on a swim team, and I have largely given up swimming because my insulin pump and Dexcom receiver are not waterproof.

My first endo told my parents in the hospital not to worry, there would be a cure within 10 years. 😆

I also have hypothyroidism(15 yrs) which is very common for t1d females. So that sucks with the side effects. I had my first pump at age 14, used that for many years but currently not on it. I do have a CGM which is awesome but man, those alarms. I haven't had a good night's sleep in so long. The sheer irritation of the sounds we get to choose from, can drive you nuts. I don't want to have 2 different sensors so until they can combine the CGM and pump into one, I think I'll stick with what I'm doing. 

I wasn't the best controlled in my younger years. I think I became defiant of my diabetes, doing the normal teenage rebellion. I still remember hearing my highest a1c while my endocrinologist was lecturing me. It was almost off the charts, I was just staring at the graph on the wall that shows a1c numbers, what was good, slowly increasing to bad. I was a 16. Awful. To make matters worse, my Mom is an RN. That was a huge asset and help when I was diagnosed but she would threaten me about taking me to the hospital to see patients with amputated limbs and blind from diabetes. She's saved my life more than a few times, having found me on the floor in the kitchen trying to get sugar in the middle of the night. 

I've had so many surgeries, it's insane. I'm basically bionic. I'm sure my bones suck because t1ds don't absorb vitamin D well, which also doesn't let you absorb calcium well either. But I was involved in some very traumatic accidents and slip and falls. My first break was from slipping on a wet floor at work when I was 21. I had a triple tib/fib fracture, one break being compound. The way I tried to stop myself from falling, I landed terribly. I had about 5 surgeries for that whole shitshow, ended up with rods and screws from knee to ankle. In 2016, I broke my right knee cap by slipping and falling on a greasy floor at Wendy's. I landed on my knee, on the tile floor. So I needed surgery immediately. Not onky did I break the patella, I tore my patellar tendon in half. They removed 1/3 of ny knee cap that was shattered and I have Kevlar implants permanently. Good times lol. Then in 2019, I had a low bs while driving. I was less than .5 miles from home. I woke up to being pulled out of my brand new, 1 month old car by firemen. So from that mess, I shattered my left leg for the 2nd time and now have permanent rods and screws in the same bones I broke the 1st time. I broke my left arm and have 2 plates, permanently. I also broke 11 ribs, front and back. I was in a wheelchair for a few months after since I couldn't use crutches and my other leg was weak from the knee cap incident. So now my good leg was my worse leg. They're equally fckd now. 😆 I have also had my appendix removed, gall bladder is gone and my daughter was born via c-section. I think my surgery total is 13 now. 

For the good news lol. After 32 years of t1d, uncontrolled at times, I still have no retinopathy whatsoever. My ophthalmologist said that's almost unheard of, that after that long even the healthiest diabetics develop retinopathy. I'm very thankful for that. I can still see well, don't use glasses despite being almost 42. I don't use any walking aids. I can get around fairly well. Am I ever going to be able to run again? Nope. I can't kneel on my right knee. Am I ever going hiking in the mountains? Fuuuuck no. 😆 

I have to laugh at myself sometimes, make jokes about my purely horrible luck. I know this disease sucks but someone else always has it worse. I truly feel sorry for that person who is worse off than me though. 😂 Just jokes. I battle depression and anxiety, which is common in t1ds. We get all of the good stuff. /s  

Does this disease piss me off sometimes? Absolutely. I can't do what healthy people can do, my life takes a lot more effort. Every time I travel, I have a fear of forgetting my supplies and being stuck without insulin. When the first waterproof pump came out, they assured me I could submerge it. I went to Virginia on vacation circa 2004, jumped in the pool, got out and it was alarming then just stopped working. So on a Sunday, around 3pm in Virginia, I had to get ahold of the on-call endocrinologist, have them call in some Lantus, then deal with insurance since I was out of state, barely got it before they closed at 5pm. This is the stuff we deal with.

I hope for every t1d, that we have a cure within our lifetime. I'm all for the pancreas transplant, I'll be a guinea pig. But apparently, they'll only do it if you're in kidney failure, then you get a double organ transplant. It's heinous to make people wait to go into kidney failure to transplant another organ. I'm sure finding 1 organ is hard enough but 2??! 😆❤️"

Yes, I have a non functioning pancreas.  Yes, I get grumpy when my blood sugar is low or high.  Yes, I have to put a new CGM sensor in every 10 days, and yes, I have to deal with an insulin pump.  However, I do not feel that I have a disability.  I am able to live my life, eat what I want, and generally do whatever the frick I want.  Are there ramifications if I manage the disease incorrectly?  Of course.  There are also ramifications if you do a lot of things.   It IS mentally exhausting to deal with this disease, but life sure is a lot easier with the management tools we have at our disposal.

I was Dx'ed when i was 12 or 13, so have been dealing with this from the days of 6+ finger pokes per day plus 4+ injections per day.

It sucks, no doubt.  But I have all of my senses, all of my appendages, and all of my brain.  The oxford definition of 'disability' is: ""a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities.""  For me, none of those boxes are checked.  My movements are not limited, my senses are not limited, and my activities are not limited.  I simply have to prepare a little more.

edit:  for those whom DO have mental or physical challenges along with this disease, I am sorry to hear that."

the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

Both can be true that this disease, along with others, is definitely difficult, but I almost try to downplay it in a way? Like, hey, at least I don't have cancer. I do have both my legs for the time being, I may have some cardiovascular problems, and my hormones are definitely fucked but that won't stop me from trying. It definitely sucks and definitely gets hard, but the only thing really keeping me going is that I know I still have the chance to find happiness in life even if it's not ideal."

I struggled with some depression back in the winter regarding my chronic illnesses (T1D + Celiac here). Not being able to eat gluten puts even more limits on what I can do. Traveling and going out to restaurants require a lot more planning and thinking. 

It sucks, but what can you do, ya know? I try to be thankful most days. Thankful that we live in the era of pumps and CGMS — could you imagine having to poke your finger 20 times a day? When I was first diagnosed at 9, that was the norm, in addition to giving myself manual injections before every meal. I’m thankful for the ever-evolving technology that will continue to make this disease easier. 

I don’t know if you watch American Ninja Warrior, but a young girl with T1D won the competition the other night. It was incredible to watch! You think about how most people without diabetes can’t even do that — it was really inspiring.

I completely understand where you’re coming from, so I don’t want to downplay your feelings. I’ve had the same thoughts, but for my own sanity, I have to find the silver lining to keep going."

I was going to start a new thread, but this one was perfect, considering my query for the forum.

Recently a widower, last year, wife had a recurrence of cancer, she had childhood cancer at 5… she got another 40 years, and it was the best 17 years of my life, no doubt… 

My question.  I have a friend who wants to set me up when I’m ready, which I’m not quite there, but this young lady is type 1 diabetic.  I think she is 42, I’m 46.   What are the ups and downs of dating someone with diabetes?  I’m the type person that would probably just roll with it, for the right person, but after being demolished recently, fear has me considering these questions, mostly because asking do I want to knowingly get into something complicated again?  There is no guarantee in life, so it’s always a gamble.. 

When I met my late wife, she had health problems, mostly from treatment as a child.. cardiac, pulmonary issues… nothing severe, but limited some things we could do… and I was aware she was higher risk for secondary cancer, but I didn’t care, all I wanted to do was be by her side… well, here I am, starting over… 

I’ll probably go out with this girl either way, because if she is awesome, what does it matter if she has limitations, it’s what you make of the time you’re given with people you care about  that really matters… 

Just interested to hear feedback from the people who live this everyday.. not the internet, not people who think they know something about diabetes.. I don’t mean to upset anyone with my question, I just like to be informed as possible… thx- B"

I truly appreciate your positive outlook because we all need to stay positive to keep going, but something you said- to OP’s point- is a straight up lie unless you’re extra special. 

Diabetes has never slowed you down? You’ve never had a low so bad that you had to stop everything you’re doing to correct and wait a while to recover? Are you like a superhuman T1D? I’m not buying it. T1D absolutely slows you down all the time in real life. Your comment embodies exactly what this post is about. 

I imagine you are speaking in broad generalizations, but I too am tired of the inauthentic nature of the way people present this and other things in their lives. It’s like the business owner who talks up how successful he is while he’s going through a divorce because he’s almost bankrupt. 

I can’t even do yard work in the heat without going dangerously low. Even when I eat a ton of carbs before, during, and after, I’m scared because of how dangerous it is. It slows me down over and over again. 

T1D is absolutely debilitating to someone who is active. Unless you’re mostly sedentary, it slows us all down."

Controlled diabetes absolutely is physically disabling, disabled doesn't mean 'physically unable'.

We are limited by diabetes, there are things that are a great deal harder, and for some of us, impossible to do safely, unlike people without diabetes. 

There are always going to be people worse off, but that doesn't stop our journey being harder because of diabetes."

I was feeling fantastic on a longer bike ride last night, but had to stop and sit down for 20 minutes to wait for my sugar to rise enough to get home. Then I have to pre-plan food and insulin starting like 4 hours before the bike ride to make sure I have basically no insulin on board and sufficiently high sugar + more carbs being digested. It fucking sucks sometimes how much planning goes in to it"

It is exhausting and frustrating. I'm often torn between the ""I can do anything"" mindset and feeling incredibly depressed and alienated. It's particularly hard because I do work out about 15 hours a week, I swim and camp and hike, but when I hit a wall with limitations, they kick my ass. Getting a cold or flu or random illness is particularly bad - I have to shut my entire life down for a week and manage massive spikes.  I have a particularly horrible family member who is really awful and lacks any empathy about it: ""stop using your illness as an excuse"" or the like. That one hurts a lot. Allow yourself to be angry about it, allow yourself to tell people they are wrong, and prep as best you can."

Not to dismiss what are real issues, but you can overcome them. You eat before the drop starts is the easiest means to combat all of what you just listed. ""But that's hard"" I have heard. Well.. I was diabetic for 20 years before hiking and completing [this trail](https://nps.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6298c848ba2a490588b7f6d25453e4e0). 

I mean it's not the longest trail out there, but those are on my list for when I have time. The issue here and in doing a hike like that is that it's a mental challenge as much as physical. If you give up you will fail."

This is very frustrating and sometimes embarressing if I was ever playing with people I didn't know, which was often the case.

These exact ones are not likely suitable to golf, they would be too much, but I use [energy gels similar to this](https://a.co/d/hZdjlrO) when backpacking. I start out eating a normal meal, and back off on my insulin dose allowing myself to go a little high (no more than 150 ish). When the activity starts my sugar drops of course but not as badly. For me I eat one of the energy gels about 1 mile in with a full (23-28lbs) pack.

Again, my food requirements would send you far to high while golfing, but with some care you can get a routine developed. Eating well before a low is key for me, when I start dropping below 90-120 I start snacking, otherwise it will be too late. That’s very activity dependent so sadly I can’t really offer more."

I disagree. Blowing off steam, venting, is an important part of dealing with anything, and a part of acknowledging reality. That's what people who are toxic in their positivity are depriving people of, and what this person is complaining about. It's great that there is nothing that you personally feel you have been prevented from doing. That's not the case for all of us, and when people hop in and accuse people of whining or being negative when they're just talking about their struggles, well, that's what I would consider a waste of energy (and one that is *far* more damaging than venting is in the first place).

And there are knock-on effects of there being so many 'I can do anything! Diabetes isn't even a disability!' style messages about diabetes out there. It's caused me to not get needed accommodations from HR people in my job, by people who say things like 'well my husband has T2 diabetes and he doesn't need those things (when I have T1). Besides, if I make accommodations for you I'll have to do it for everyone!' (literally untrue according to the ADA). I could do with a *little* more drama in messaging about diabetes, but mostly because I think about 95% of the people around me at any given moment are under the impression that I will be fine / it's not a big deal *even if I run out of insulin*."

We have to live our lives differently than other people and it does limit us sometimes.

I’m actually getting really tired of everyone acting like diabetes makes you just like everybody else except you take insulin, because it’s not true for most of us, especially those of us with hormonal influences or imbalances that interfere with it even further. God forbid you have any other cooccurring illnesses on top of the diabetes, that can make it even worse.

Plus it makes me feel like I have to push through whatever diabetes is throwing at me to do whatever thing I wanted to do, which then makes it feel like I’m giving up if I stop/can’t do the thing and have to take care of myself.

1.  Call old endo, explain situation, and have the write a 6 month script to tide you over to pharmacy in new place or a nationwide chain.  Docs can write prescriptions without any fuss if you've seen them in the last 12 months.  
2. Go to a clinic in CVS or Walgreens or the like and have the NP or doc write you a script.  There is literally a box they can choose that says ""waiting on appointment"" from a specialist.  it's much cheaper and easier than going to ER.  
3. OTC from Walmart.  But be very, very careful and make sure you read up on how these old insulins work.  There's a reason we don't use them much anymore!"

Hence, after the newly diagnosed diabetic will often experience the honeymoon period after starting to take insulin, as the fatigued overworked cells get a break once there is insulin from another source, and start producing insulin more efficiently again. 

So presumably, it can halt the further progress of the disease and your body will keep producing some insulin indefinitely. Possibly you could just take a dose of background insulin and not have to dose for most meals. 

I believe your body also gets worse at producing glucagon over time, and so your body doesn’t fix lows itself - this might help with that as well."

For example, these may be estimated based on the proportion of people in that age group with a diagnostic code which is nonspecific to just “diabetes” or “dysglycemia”. It could also be after searching drug databases for the proportion of people who are taking any antidiabetic agent, which, in the case of insulin, isn’t specific to either type 1 or 2, so they have to make this generalization. Not many countries have awesome data that can allow researchers to drill down to get specific data, and collecting/analyzing this kind of data is wrought with assumptions."

How do I change the address Dexcom sends things to?,"Apologies if this is common knowledge. I made my first Dexcom product support request a few months ago while living in off-campus college housing. Since then, I've moved home for the summer, *but Dexcom continues to send products to the previous address*. No one lives at the previous address, so I can't have it forwarded to me. My last Dexcom sensor failed during warmup and I requested a new one and I specifically entered my home address (where I am currently living) on the form, but Dexcom *still* sent the replacement to the old (inaccessible, in another state) address. I am frustrated and I can't figure out how to change the address so Dexcom stops sending things to a house where no one currently lives - not to mention that the sensor is expensive and I really could have used that... Any help would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14mnqtg/how_do_i_change_the_address_dexcom_sends_things_to/,The form is useless for address changes.

I’ve been doing the math for over 30 years and generally it’s an equation with many variables.  Time has taught me how the combination of two variables creates additional variables.

1 What’s my CGM say?
2 What’s the trend arrow?
3 How do I feel?
4 What am I going to eat?
5 What did my sugar do the last time I ate this?
6 How many net carbs?
7 Is there anything still in my stomach preventing the absorption of this meal?
8 Are the quick or delayed carbs?
9 What protein did I eat in the last 6 hours?
10 Has my last dose of rapid insulin completely wore off?
11 How much do I plan to eat?
12 Is there still unprocessed protein in my stomach?
13 Did I drink a carbonated beverage, because the CO2 can block the absorption of carbs until it’s released(burping)
14 What time of day is it and at what point of my long acting insulin’s journey am I?
15 Am I going to be sitting, standing or walking in the next two hours?
16 What’s my hydration level? 
17 Do I have enough candy within reach in case it drops?
18 Where on my body am I going to inject?

Just a few variables lol."

Then a week later have the same meal do the same bolus and sky rocket.

That may be because you're not using (or don't have) all of the relevant information to make a decision.

For example: at the time you ate both meals, was you blood sugar the same beforehand and was it heading in the same direction at about the same rate? If you eat a meal with your bsl on the rise and only bolus for the food, then you're going to end up higher than if your blood suggar was dropping and you bolused only for the food. The faster you were rising or dropping, the bigger the difference.

And this isn't even remotely close to all of the information that can help you get your calculation, or educated guess, right (as u/pricklyfuzzball alludes to). If you actually have the information (this is where CGM makes a huge difference) and the understanding of how all of the different factors work together or offset each other, the chances of being in control and not just being along for the ride improve dramatically."

Folks wearing Dexcom have fluctuated higher than that.   I’m sure you could find somebody with a fully functional pancreas who went out of range for some period of time.

It can happen for example to someone to go low on sugars, you've surely seen someone having to stop while exercising. Their body however restores the normal functions with glucagon, increasing the glucose production. We kinda don't. Not because we can't but because often the condition of hyperinsulinimia hinders glucagon's production. 

Anyway, normal people who eat a ton of sweets would easily go over 140. It's just that since their bodies produce more insulin when necessary, it's just a brief moment before the pancreas goes ""huh, we gotta pump some more here"". 

Just the harsh reality of diabetes"

We struggle mightily to achieve a >75% but I wonder what a normal one is?,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14miikt/normal_time_in_range/,"non-t1 is around 96% in range (80-160), with a variation of 17% with 2% time over 140 and 1% time under 70

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296129/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296129/)

Average glucose was 99.

What gear are you using? It's a lot easier to get 75% TIR if:

a) you are not a child or teen

b) you are not female or don't have strong hormonal responses to insulin

c) you don't drink too much alcohol

d) you use ultra fast acting - FIASP, Lyumenyev, Afrezza

e) you are using either a DIY system like Loop or APS or an FDA system like Tslim or Omnipod 5.

My daughter is 9, avg glucose over 90 days is 136, SD is 48, TIR is 85% and she has less than 1% very low / 1% low readings - she Loops and uses FIASP. At times we have gotten her avg glucose to 105-110 with an SD in the low 20s but that's with frequent interventions / adjustments.

The advantage of ultra fast is you can almost eliminate 250+ readings (we're at 2%) which conversely reduces your risk of serious lows (b/c you don't have to ""rage bolus"" to bring down a high).  


There are a good number of adults who Loop / APS who can achieve near non-diabetic numbers w/o pre-bolus by having really spot on settings AND use ultra fast insulin.

FIASP has a number of downsides as it reportedly causes more pump occlusions (and so far we've had 6 in the last 2 months when we almost never had any before) and it can be painful for folks. BUT, when it works, it's a gamechanger on two levels - first, you don't have to prebolus nearly as far ahead AND if you do go high, the highs \_tend\_ to be a lot less steep. That of course leads to the downside, if you start going high && you have a pump failure, it can take longer to recognize (b/c you become accustomed to FIASP solving your 200-250 BG readings). 

  
We've had 3 400+ readings (HIGH) since switching over whereas we had one in the 12 months prior.

W/o those high readings, I think our avg bg would be in the 110s."

I then tested with a meter and my BG was around 180ish. I was kind if shocked at that. I usually never drink soda but imagine people you see walking around drinking soda all day. They are probably out of range much of the time. Also, we found that my t1d daughter may have smaller meal spikes with a pre bolus compared to me if i eat fruit or something with a meal. not always, but sometimes."

Last night after training I had the bolus I give myself for lighter meals (even though I thought I ate a normal amount of carbs). And then I lowered my basal from 18 to 16 before bed.

I backpack, so different activity and you will have to adjust for yours,  and use energy gel packs about 1 mile in and that works for me. I'd say you need to find a snack you can eat about 15-20 minutes after starting. 

You will have to keep track and watch both your reading, and if using a CGM how fast it's going down to balance it out. The key thing is eat much earlier than you think you should. If I start at 145 I eat as soon as my sugar passes 95. Wait too long and you will be in a low before the food is absorbed into your system."

Nacho Fernandez just recently became the primary captain of Real Madrid!

In one game the running might be more intense than another, he might play a whole game or only some of it or not at all, the game could take place at different times of day affecting his meal/bolus times, he might have different amounts of insulin on board at any given match or training.

He's probably an expert by now but as a newer diabetic I just don't get how T1 athletes do it, I can easily go low if I take a walk an hour or 2 after bolusing."

On that same pedal pedal bike (some people call them “acoustic bikes”?) I do Uber eats and bike camping.

For short commutes to work (less than 5 miles or 30 min.) I prefer to ride fasted and depending on where my BG is, maybe a kind bar. Just turn off the pump, get a shower, ride to work, turn on pump and breakfast time 😀. 

Higher BG’s aren’t so much of a problem for long distance endurance riding, because the risk of passing out from hypos is much worse when you’re in the middle of the street or a trail somewhere. The trick is to learn how much to reduce your basal during the activity so that still not fall too low, while reducing spikes caused by adrenaline release. 

Also, for long distance and endurance sports, eating is your fuel and carbs are your friend! But, have to use a higher I:C ratio to compensate for the fact that your muscles can uptake glucose without the use of insulin. When you pushing your body harder, your muscles are soaking up glucose like a sponge. Too much insulin + too much activity = hypos. 

Also, stay hydrated. I love liquid IV’s!!!

You look to be dropping a bit before it kicked in, which would suggest your basal is a little high for today. 

Our needs fluctuate all the time so not uncommon to sometimes drop a little one day and then do something completely different the next. But, if it happens repeatedly over the next few days then you might want to drop your basal 1 or 2 units.

Alternatively,  it could still be your bolus and there are other considerations like the glycaemic load of the carbs you consumed. ie, if low gi then the insulin might kick in quicker than the carbs.

All in all, based on the incomplete info we have, this just looks a decent bolus with some minor other factor causing  a fluctuation. Keep an eye on a repeating trend."

Can I still use these?,"Hey, 
I wanted to ask whether these expired glucose test stripes could still be used… probably not I guess, but before I throw them away I just wanted to ask. One of my endos told me in the past that expired insulin is almost always still good to use, so I wonder if this could also be true for test stripes… (btw, I have never used expired insulin despite her predication)",https://i.redd.it/5qgjaj5vc09b1.jpg,"The official answer will be no, ultimately because of the enzyme (organic componds like glucose oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase) used to make the strips break down over time, that is the key factor in the exp date.

This is a good skim to help you know about test strips as people will say yes and no.

https://www.diabetes.co.uk/blog/2015/05/can-people-with-diabetes-use-expired-blood-glucose-test-strips/

""However, anecdotal evidence suggests that whether a strip is a day, a week or month expired, you may not be able to observe differentiation in test readings....

....The answer is no, but you are much more likely to receive a faulty reading as the enzyme wears down over time. An expired test strip of two years, for example, is extremely likely to provide an inaccurate result."""

And none of the things I’m currently unhappy with are because of diabetes. There are opportunities I’ve missed out on because of T1 that I do feel bitter about sometimes, and now that I’m at the point in life where I’m looking at how pregnancy will go for me, I do get pretty bitter and upset sometimes. But all are moments that I process and let them pass. 

Not to diagnose from behind a keyboard, but you clearly have depression. Whether that’s because of the pressure of T1 or it’s just magnifying it, no one else can say. Neither condition has to rob you of happiness and with help you can get to a good place with both. Sounds cliche, but as everyone is going to tell you here, it’s true."

I don't think I missed out on much.  I was active as a kid, played sports in school, and started my own business before I finished college.  Honestly, being diabetic probably actually kept me from doing some dumb(er) things when I was younger.  

As I've said over and over on these subs, it's all mental.  Make peace with it and move on.  Why dwell on the things that you can't change?  Play the hand you're dealt and make the most of it.  You only get one life.  Make the most of it before it's gone."

I regret working so hard for a life I’m dissatisfied with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14lhfw9/how_many_of_you_are_happy/,"The way I see it, barely anyone stays able-bodied forever. Everyone gets hit with something, there are loads of disabilities out there and people who are perfectly healthy their entire lives get hit with things later on in life wether they like it or not. That’s the nature of being human, our bodies are designed to stop working at some point. For some people it’s earlier. Even when you look at mental health problems, those can also be lifelong and quite debilitating. It may feel like you’re on your own with this type of disability, but the truth is everyone’s just dealing with different types. A lot of people are already dealing w disabilities but are too scared and stubborn to go to the doctors for a diagnosis. 

I don’t think happiness is something that can be achieved. It’s just an emotion and feeling, same as satisfaction with your life. You’ll always have regrets and things you wish you would’ve done, disabled or not. There are always opportunities to be missed. There will always be limitations on things you can do, I think it’s more a matter of acceptance and being at peace with that. Because there isn’t anything inherently wrong with it. I love space, but I’ll never reach the moon. And that’s fine.

I use to run regularly and be in the top 10% of amateur Triathalons. I could do that more again if I got on a pump. However I’m okay with the occasional jog. 

I kayak whitewater, go camping, take hikes, cycling etc. Knew a guy who was even a raft guide for a couple seasons. 

My partner likes diving and the company had no issue taking me if I wanted to join in. Just had to have the sugars up.

OP u/sparrow280 from the little you've shared here, a few suggestions:

1. [find a therapist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) who specializes in chronic illness and grief
2. [work with your inner child](https://www.betterup.com/blog/inner-child-work#:~:text=t%20remember%20it.-,What%20is%20inner%20child%20work%3F,unmet%20needs%20by%20reparenting%20ourselves), get your hands on opportunities you feel you ""missed out on"" (can you label those? how can you bring those into adulthood now?)

It's not hard to feel like diabetes makes doing life challenging -- big facts -- it takes a lot more prep to go out & be in the world, but you can do it! Some days & excursions will be easier than others, and that's just the way life goes 🫶💙

Everyone misses out on opportunities, whether they have T1D or not. The important thing is not to waste the opportunities you still have. In 10 years you will look back on this moment and say ""I wish I had done XXX 10 years ago!""

>After work I usually go home, lift weights, and then sit on my recliner and stare at the wall until bedtime.

Why don't you pick up some new hobbies? You could join a Rock Climbing gym if you want to get a workout and be social. You could get a Mountain Bike and explore your town / woods. Or if you prefer to stay at home you could play video games with friends or try a creative outlet like music or art.

If you have lots of free time and money, why not spend some of it? Go on a day trip somewhere exciting. Buy yourself a new toy (Drone, Steam Deck, 3D Printer, Motorcycle). Treat yourself, you literally earned it.

It sounds like you are depressed in general. It's totally normal and everyone has these feelings sometimes. It's important to talk with others and make connections."

I got a BSBA and I work my ass off. I got married, I had a kid, I got divorced. I got fired. I was unemployed. I got a better job. 
I've camped two nights at Havasupai Falls with a 13 mile hike in and out, I've sky-dived, bungee-jumped (one time at an Oktoberfest in Mexico), I  snowboard, I ride motorcycles, and enjoy a good 4x4 trip occasionally. I love more than anything to drive a good set of twisties in my sports car. 
I've also spent many years drinking too much, and/or doing drugs. I've enjoyed my fair share of psychedelics and I still enjoy smoking too much weed pretty regularly.
I say make the most of your life and do what you can to enjoy it your own way, or die trying...
33 years since diagnosis and thankfully doing well with no major complications. Last A1C was 6.7. Living a long healthy life with T1D is more likely than ever. The technology makes a good life so much more likely and much EASIER than ever before (this should not be understated). T1D forces you to pay attention to what you put in your body, which is a leg up health-wise compared to many people in this world.  
Sing it with me, ""Life's been good to me... even with T1D...!""  
*Please not my experiences may not be advisable, or even enjoyable, to others and that's OK by me! Find your own enjoyment within your own tolerance and live your life your very own way."

I thought the same thing to be honest.   


I consider myself to be incredibly happy... and I say this having stage 4 cancer on top of diabetes. My illnesses certainly are a part of my wellbeing, but in no way all of it. I have an amazing social network of friends I talk to regularly who bring me so much comfort and laughter; I have hobbies that make my life feel meaningful and give me hope for a brighter tomorrow; I get outside to a park everyday and find that incredibly rejuvenating; I keep a journal that helps me appreciate what I have and work through things; and I do my best to get the sleep and nutrition I need so my body feels as good as it can. I also recognize I've been fortunate for things more outside my control: a successful career, supportive family, and I live in a more ""socialist""/developed society (I can't think of a better word for it... but what I mean is a place with universal healthcare and decent amounts of social supports around, both private and public). That's made it so I am well provided for and financially secure so I don't worry much about needing to find a place to live or food to eat.... which is, unfortunately (because it's not always in our control), a part of happiness as well.

I think some days I just wake up and choose to be happy and find the things to be grateful for. Honestly, choosing happiness and hope helps me work through the shit I have going on, which has also been important (I could easily deny, downplay, or numb it, but, in the end, that doesn't really help anything... I feel like it's been better for me to confront the shit and appreciate it too)."

Like I fear going on walks or doing sports. My sugar always drops insanely fast over the most mundane of physical activities and I do not understand how any other diabetic is able to manage it easily.

I have to prepare beforehand and make sure its been hours since I've had insulin and usually have 30+ carbs before I do anything physical. Literally mowing the lawn (push mower) for like 20minutes and my blood sugar drops from 250 to like 150. And usually for the rest of the day my sugar will be wonky and weird. It's just not worth all that effort most of the time.

Also, there is nothing good about this disease. I understand that you want positivity, but I have never once thought about this in a positive light. Normally the less I think about it, the better. Which is why I avoid even going on this subreddit cause people bitch a lot and I get reminded of the struggle, sometimes its comforting though."

I feel this with the whole ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" phrase... like, for some people that's just way more doable than for others. 

I also really hate the obsession with happiness too (at least, where I live). Like, sometimes people make it out to be some end-all-be-all. As if there's something wrong with people if they're not happy. Because of this, I think happiness has also been turned into a commodity — there's a lot of messaging that is meant to make me unhappy (if only you were more attractive, if only you made more money, if only you were more interesting, if only you were smarter, etc) so that happiness can be sold back to me via products and experiences, which actually bring a very empty happiness (like empty-carbs).

I have sensors, i have a pump... like everything i wanted to make things easier but it doesnt. There are few days when i can put aside diabetes. Most of the days, flow of insulin blocked, out of the blue...like right now exactly when i wanted to go the sleep my sensor is not reading.

"Scary morning loss of vision, what next? (M23)","

Woke up yesterday with a flashing like spot in my vision. I had slept for 11 hours after a physical day at work, skipped dinner went straight to bed. (Active duty army) Anything I focused on didn’t seem to exist. My peripheral vision was decent enough to cause me to remain at least a little calm. (I’ve noticed in the past where I feel shaky and anxious having a cup of juice helps.)

I tried to get along with my day, but after showering my entire vision starting flickering. Things started to get worse and I got more anxious.I laid back in a state of panic about to make the call to go to the hospital. I made the correlation that my body does weird things sometimes and sugar seems to help. I grabbed a frozen sugar pop and within 30 seconds to a minute I was back to normal. 

I know I should probably go make an appointment urgently as I have some type of sugar issue. (Night sweats, fatigue, sugar cravings) I have a pretty bad fear of medical care and getting my blood drawn. What exactly could this be though?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14moluo/scary_morning_loss_of_vision_what_next_m23/,that sounds a awful lot like a scintillating scotoma. i get these about half an hour before a migraine. i'm sure there're other reasons you could be experiencing that.

Vision issues to my knowledge could be a result of both frequent highs or lows. Just make the appointment dude, I promise you it’s better to deal with now rather than later and that’s such a cliché thing to say but I mean that. 

I would ask a few questions such as, how often are you checking your sugars, do you have a CGM, is your army line of work very very psychical (may be a stupid question) 

The most important thing though, Don’t let yourself get freaked out man, I did that and made things much worse for myself and put myself in situations where I ended up in the hospital way too much (because I avoided the doctor) resulting in major medical ptsd from going to the hospital so much and being rushed every time I had to go. I cryyyyyyyyy immediately if I think I have to go. 

And believe me, you don’t want to know how many needles you’ll be dealing with if you’re admitted for any amount of days. Never less than 2 IV’s every time I’ve been in and they need to be changed every couple days. Do not avoid it, go to the doctor, don’t be scared- don’t get all in your head."

(Active duty army) Anything I focused on didn’t seem to exist. My peripheral vision was decent enough to cause me to remain at least a little calm. (I’ve noticed in the past where I feel shaky and anxious having a cup of juice helps.)

I tried to get along with my day, but after showering my entire vision starting flickering. Things started to get worse and I got more anxious.I laid back in a state of panic about to make the call to go to the hospital. I made the correlation that my body does weird things sometimes and sugar seems to help. I grabbed a frozen sugar pop and within 30 seconds to a minute I was back to normal. 

I know I should probably go make an appointment urgently as I have some type of sugar issue. (Night sweats, fatigue, sugar cravings) I have a pretty bad fear of medical care and getting my blood drawn. What exactly could this be though?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14moluo/scary_morning_loss_of_vision_what_next_m23/,What do you mean? The way your post reads indicates that you are active duty army. Are you in the military? If so how did you get in.
Will Dexcom send you a replacement sensor even if you use an 'incompatible phone' and BYOD?,"So I inserted a G7 sensor today and my phone just won't find it to pair, was trying for over a half hour.

Inserted another sensor in the other arm and it paired immediately.

It's clearly the sensor itself that was faulty and I'd like to ring Dexcom and get it replaced, but I'm worried that if they ask what phone I have or the fact that I use Build Your Own Dexcom to make it work, they'll blame it on that and not send me a new one because of compatibility issues even though that's definitely not it.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation, are they a bit cutthroat or would they happily send out another?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/14m29hd/will_dexcom_send_you_a_replacement_sensor_even_if/,Yes they will replace. They will ask for your dexcom used if but rarely ask what phone it is. If you do get asked just say it’s one of the compatible phones (I think BYOD masks it as a pixel 4).  You can also just do a claim on their website. Just remember to keep the serial number from the box.

Why is my FreeStyle Libre 2 so inaccurate?,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14madza,I know this is a bit late but I completely disagree with what the replies say. They can just be widely inaccurate from time to time.
Why is my FreeStyle Libre 2 so inaccurate?,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14madza,It isn't. 15 mins previously you were 60. The libre2 is 15 mins behind
Why is my FreeStyle Libre 2 so inaccurate?,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14madza,Well that doesn’t seem safe. Why would they make it like that? If I’m low and don’t feel it I could be drastically lower 15 minutes later.
Why is my FreeStyle Libre 2 so inaccurate?,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14madza,Just the way cgms work due to getting readings from fluid rather than blood. They're for trends rather than up to date figures so you could have seen an hour ago that you were nosediving rapidly and done something about it.

The dogs have jumped me and knocked my FSL2 out my arm before, and I’ve also flicked it off pulling on a backpack etc.)

It’s also not waterproof, just resistant.

I've ordered some sports tape just yesterday. He won't use tape all the time or anything but it seems in principle (yet to confirm) it may help for this kind of thing (he's not cage fighting but he does other shenanigans) and I don't think it will mess with transmission unless I mummify the lads arm in the shit. I got some fancy ""D3"" brand and it was about 10 bucks AUD for a ~14 meter roll but there's way cheaper stuff, I figured we'll see how it goes, at worst we'll chuck it in with the first aid stuff anyway and use it for other purposes and no great loss. General idea though is hard to rip off if taped on all the way around his arm."

I’ve used both fsl 2 and am currently on dexcom g6. 

When I moved to cgms they fell off all the damn time but I don’t think I’ve lost one in bjj for over a year now (although my omnipod is a different matter). 

I put it on my Tricep but really high up towards my shoulder (too high to get caught during arm drags).  I put some gauze over it and tape around it but honestly, not sure that makes a difference. Sweat has never been a problem. 

If we’re in a position when rolling where my partner is feeling around near my dexcom I ask them just to be careful. 

On the odd occasion sweat does loosen the glue, I put an over patch over it for the rest of its life. 

I prefer dexcom over the fsl. It sticks better and is more accurate."

Bc you do contact sport I would also say that you should consider wearing your monitor on your stomach. It seems like it’s going to be awful with waist bands etc, but I find it much better. FSL2 also deffo falls off with sweat so I use skin tac, and sometimes an additional cover over the monitor to hold the sticky bit in place better"

It’s amazing control but still generating a profit, the ideal capitalist scenario.  At this point, they have a money-in-the-bank revenue stream from all of us.

I’m assuming you are using auto mode? If not, then it’s clear your manual settings/basal is off and needs adjusting. There are podcasts on the omnipod website (3 of them) that I highly recommend listening to. 

I changed to omnipod and have had my ups and downs. My biggest takeaways are that high blood sugar is soooo hard to get back down with the omnipod so keeping it low and controlled is key. Now that sounds impossible to a diabetic but my next best advice is truly sticking to the 15-30 minutes bolus prior to eating. It’s not also perfect but if you have some insulin there it’s much better than none. Remember that insulin is much less effective when blood sugar is elevated. 

Would love to help out with this as much as I can because I’ve been in your shoes. I had a great first week on the omnipod then was truly shocked how bad it was and frustrated to the point I was going back to my old pump. My rep told me the good news is that it was good before so confident it can be good again. Just need some tweaks.

I really don’t think insulin is the only thing to blame here. Structurally, they are very similar with some differences in amino acids substitutions that only affect the rate in which the body adsorbs the insulin. You should really be 50:50 for your basal to bolus ratio and seems like you are getting almost all of your insulin from bolus. The system is different than most automated pumps so adjustments may be needed. 

Also, is there any possibility of your insulin being stored improperly? Once opened you get 28 days at room temp and fridge. But keep in mind that excessive temps with DRAMATICALLY decrease causing much faster degradation and efficacy will be poor."

I have been hypothyroid for the last 20 years. Was dx 2/2023 with LADA. I have since learned hypothyroidism is often seen prior to T1.5 (LADA).  I wish my doctor would have ordered gad antibody test for me periodically to monitor if T1.5 was developing.  I was very fortunate to not be misdiagnosed as T2-Thanks to a very smart and curious nurse. Looking back I wish someone would have told me to watch for symptoms of LADA as it often goes hand in hand with hypothyroidism. btw- my A1c was normal at yearly physical and less than 6 months later almost 11%.  When it happens it can happen fast (at least for me).
Maybe you can relate,"I was dignosed at 8 when my teacher talked with my mom about how often I had been asking to go to the restroom. My mom, fortunately, correctly recognised it as a sign of diabetes.

Listening to a friend of a friend's wife:
""My husband cured it with dieting and mineral water. Look it up but the mineral water just has to be sourced from Malaysia""
Me: ""Did he have type 1?""
Her: ""I think it was type 1... Yeah, I think so.""

Another conversation with a rando:
""Oh, I could never take insulin, I hate needles.... You prick your finger how many times a day?""

In the hospital, when I was diagnosed at 8yrs old, I called it ""diet-beebees"". I saw my parents were worried so I tried to lighten the mood by joking ""I may have the BBs but I dont have the gun!"" It doesnt make much sense looking back, but I was 8 and my parents loved how much I took it all in good humor. I tried to take it well and I think it made them feel more at ease.

I am on Fiasp, I have the cartridges that go into one of those pens that record how much you take..  


Buuut as i am forgetful, I took some of the last pre filled pens (still fiasp) and i kept them in the cooler at work (not fridge, cooler!) they went right up to the use by date and i needed on (used by 05\_2023 and i used them in May)... It worked better than my cartridges!  


I know this is anecdotal but its true.. I have a problem with injecting and not seeing anything happen for hours sometimes it feels like it has just not worked, and then either i crash, or i take a rage bolus and then it super crashes.. but every time I needed to use the prefilled pen it always seemed to work better...  


I kinda wanna go back to them, but i am trying to get a pump so love that my pen records my doses so the nurse can see it."

Do you mean cumulatively what's lost in the filling and priming process or what you'd ""leave in the cartridge"" each time?  I fill my cartridge to cover the days of use.  I'm on Novolog and aim for 3.5-4 days.  On previous pumps, when I went over five, I'd notice a loss of efficacy.  Whether it was the insulin, site or combination of both, I can't say with 100% certainty.  But insulin in a plastic bag in a warm ""container"" for days on end is not a good thing."

Constant fatigue + recent weight loss - high sugar level symptoms?,"Hi all!

I've always been quite fatigued since being diagnosed, but the past couple months has been ROUGH, every day I could nap halfway through.

My sugar levels definitely are sitting higher and I struggle to get them down recently. Usually sitting above 10 and spike up to 20. I take insulin, it goes down, then it goes back up. Very annoying.


Recently, I noticed I've dropped around 5kg in about a month. Now, I have been eating slightly healthier and less food in general, but thats thats a lot. (Gone from 104.8 to 99.9, roughly.)

Could a higher HB1AC be causing this? Just did the blood test this morning, so waiting on results, but I definitely know it's higher. Clarity app even puts it around 8.9% for past 3 months.

Honestly no idea what mine was when diagnosed, but last time it was.... 7.2%? which is still high but it come down, though this was.. 8 months ago. I'm worried it has jumped way up.

Glad to hear (I guess?) you think it's possible, especially for the weight loss. There was a moment where I gained a LOT of weight because I increased my insulin, almost 15kg. 

I'll have to wait for results and discuss with my doctor then!"
