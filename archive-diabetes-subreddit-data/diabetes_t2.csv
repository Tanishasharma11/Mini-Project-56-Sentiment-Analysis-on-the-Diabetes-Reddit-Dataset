New Rules (Medical Advice and Diagnosis),"Hello All,

Based on some recent posts we have added two new rules. 

1) No Seeking a Diabetes Diagnosis/No ""Do these symptoms look like Diabetes"": While we can fully appreciate the concerns over unusual symptoms. We are not doctors. It is best to speak with your doctor about your concerns.

2) No Giving/Requesting Medical Advice: We are not doctors and would not be aware of someone's full condition. If you need medical advice please seek out your doctor. As well please do not give medical advice other then to contact a doctor.

Please make sure to report any posts or comments you feel are breaking these rules. They are meant to keep people safe as like the rules say we are not doctors and should not be acting like them.

Thanks all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/vpp2or/new_rules_medical_advice_and_diagnosis/,[]
A1c went up,"Just got my a1c back and it’s 7.9, up from 6.9 last time. Had some house guests over a month ago and ate like i was non-diabetic, lots of candies, cookies, sweets, and carbs galore.  Doc added another med (Acarbose). Already on Jardiance, Metformin, & Glipizide.  Kind of bummed to have another pill to take.  
-Wondering if anyone is taking Acarbose and if you’ve had side effects?

They tend to be heart and kidney protective as well. oral medication. \n* Sulfonylurea - stimulate insulin making beta cells in the pancreas to create more insulin to combat high blood sugar. These are pretty old, have some side effects, and long term use is linked to beta cell burnout. Oral medication. \n* GLP-1 Receptor Agonist - stimulate the GLP-1 receptor to produce more insulin when eating, basically. They also suppress some of the livers activity, so less glucose being released from liver stores into the blood stream. Also help with insulin sensitivity. Usually injectable, but there are a couple oral meds.\n* DPP-4 inhibitor - very similar mechanism to GLP-1ra, just a different way of doing it. It inhibits an enzyme, resulting in higher levels of certain hormones (like GLP-1). Usually oral medication. \n* Metformin - suppresses the liver releasing glucose, and increases glucose utilization in muscles and liver. Oral medication. \n\nThat’s the general list, I’m sure I forgot something, but this was just off the top of my head.

"Which CGM and Where to buy? (will have a prescription, have insurance but prob paying cash and using an iPhone)",I'm not holding my breath about insurance paying. I am pre diabetic. I want to use one for a couple of months to see what affects me and what does not. My doctor has no problem writing me a prescription and I need to know where to send it (walmart or cvs or ?). I want it to work with my iPhone. I recently saw someone complaining about one CGM app no longer working right on their iPhone.

Without Costco’s coupons, the total cost would’ve been $143 for two sensors (28-day supply); the pharmacist at Costco entered their coupon, and my total was $65.\n\nI will caution you that I don’t recommend Lifestyle 3 Libre’s CGM. The sensor was wildly inaccurate and made me stressed out more.\n\nIf I could do it all over again, I’d try the DEXCOM sensor. It’s more expensive, but I hear it’s much more accurate. \n\nBottom line: If you want a CGM, you’ll most likely pay out of pocket.

Even when someone is not on insulin, it’s completely helpful that a CGM helps inform a person when to eat and exercise, and what foods to avoid. There are some things I’ve eaten that I’d have no idea I should avoid if it were not for the CGM.

I was citing common thinking.  Coverage by insurance Companies varies of course.  Generally, people say it is tied to how much insulin they use.  \n\nCGMs track in real time the status of their levels.if it is high they react.  If it low, they eat something.  If they eat something that spikes  their sugars,they learn not to eat it, they adjust insulin.\n\nSo yes what I say is true.  There is no reason, no benefit for a pre diabetic to use a CGM.  For one thing, there is an expense.  Another reason is that  people assume they are OK.  Another is that someone not diabetic has sugars under control.\n\nI rely on research and experiences when I post about health.', ""i fill mine at Kroger and pay out of pocket.  They give a discount for people without insurance coverage and it's $75 for 2.  So, that's not much more than Costco is.  Dexcom is a LOT more expensive for out of pocket."", 'I strongly disagree for many reasons including that someone may already have type 2 diabetes, but is often presumed to have pre-diabetes based on a single fasting blood glucose reading, and maybe their A1C in addition to that. Still, a person has similar, albeit less urgent, challenges when they are pre-diabetic- often needing a lower carb diet, more exercise, and a fair degree of weight loss. Prevention is the best medicine, but it is unhelpful when a person is not given the tools they need to manage their health effectively. Some will say a CGM is unnecessary and they may well be right. Even somebody with type 1 diabetes can manage their disease without one, but that doesn’t mean they can do so as effectively. It’s just common sense that if a person has the information they need to make decisions about their health, then they are empowered to do so.\n\nBesides, the data that CGMs gather is completely useful to doctors too. Had I been given one, even just for screening me for diabetes, then I would have been diagnosed much earlier. Based on when I first recalled having symptoms (ex: excessive thirst) then type 2 probably started with me nearly two years prior. However, the standards screening did not even detect pre-diabetes because, incidentally, I already followed a low carb diet. It wasn’t until my A1C skyrocketed to 16.2 and I came down with ketoacidosis before anybody detected something was awry.', 'The debate started  when you claimed what I said was not true.

I have read about other people’s experience.\n\nYou are talking about perceived benefits to you.   That is what you think and that is fine.  But is not objectively true.  As a matter of fact there are no benefits for a CGM for a pre diabetic.  Not much for people on metformin either.\n\nI have been diabetic 19 years.  I appreciate the insights about the illness from people that do not have it.\n\nI actually read your post.  Your initial post  said that you were pre diabetic.  Your last post  you claimed A1C 16.2.  I can safely say you are diabetic,  lucky to be alive.  Yes a CGM would help someone who is diabetic likely to go on insulin.\n\nYour statements are factually wrong.  You interchange pre diabetic and diabetic terms.\n\nYes a T1 would benefit from a CGM.\n\nBasically you expressed your opinion.  I stated facts.', 'I never said that I was pre-diabetic. I have type 2 diabetes.', 'Sorry. I responded to OP', 'It’s okay, and I think you are right on some points, but I don’t see it as harmful for people to wear a CGM to gather health data, whether or not it is justified because of diabetes. It is my opinion because I believe, in principle, that people need more access to information about their health, not less.', 'I hope I did not imply it was harmful.  But for OP, it was unnecessary.

Forxiga the miracle drug?,Due to my hectic travel schedule to the most remote rural areas my numbers have been really bad. As a result my doctor put me on forxiga + 3 500mg metformin five days ago and my numbers are looking like a miracle! I searched and tried to find as much as I can from experiences of others but haven’t been able to find much. I also worry about the possible side effects and how long this “miracle drug” can last before it causes side effects. I’ve also make sure to wash/wet wipe myself after peeing due to the risk of UTI and so far it’s good. Is there anyone that is also on it and if you have any advice to share?

Blood sugar went from floating around 200+ all day long to being in the low 100s.  Basically, if my liver wanted to make a ton of glucose, it was free to do that and Farxiga made sure the excess had somewhere else to go.  This helped me more quickly go from uncontrolled diabetes to controlled diabetes and then after that as long as I fixed my diet and kept it where it needed to be, my blood sugar remained in good shape.\n\nAt first I questioned if maybe I should have went with a GLP1 instead, but now I'm really glad I didn't.

My t2 diabetes journey,"7 yrs ago I was diagnosed as t2 diabetic with an a1c of 6.9. My dr wrote me an Rx for metformin, but I told her I would do it with diet alone (I was a vegan at the time, and had been one for many years).

I tried lowcarb but it was hard bc unknown yet to me and my dr, I had severe sleep apnea, which can cause food cravings for sugar and starches.

The following year they found out I had sleep apnea. Once that was treated, lowcarb became much easier bc my appetite changed to not want anything sweet or starchy.

Today my a1c is 4.9 and has been for several years.

My diet for 6 yrs has been very low carb and higher fat from natural meats, eggs, etc. I'm the total opposite of a vegan now, and all my health issues are gone: hypertension, weight gain, fatty liver, high eye pressure that could've led to glaucoma, brain fog, fatigue, and more.

Update: AITA diabetic edition,"Well, buoyed by your responses on here ( thanks everyone!) I had a bit of a come to Jesus talk with my fiancé.  
We talked about why he felt so overwhelmed and it basically boiled down to he feels like an idiot because he didn’t even know what I was talking about when I told him to avoid starchy foods.  SOooo! I went online and printed him three lists of foods : green light ( meats, eggs, fats, etc) stuff with minimal impact on blood sugar, yellow light stuff to go easy on ( fruit, beans , etc).  And stuff that I will kick your butt if you eat it ( anything with  high fructose corn syrup, sugar, white bread, pasta).  Also gave him a crash course on exactly WHY high sugar is so bad and the long term effects. 
He told me he ate exactly what I told him to all week and he weighed himself and was 10 lbs lighter.  We checked his fasting blood sugar and it had already dropped by 10 ( 150 to 140).  I also taught him to check his own blood sugar. 
He was so relieved he cried and said he can keep this up now that he knows it works. 
He’s still digging his heels in about a dr appointment and we basically agreed that if he gets his blood sugar down to normal levels within 3 months I won’t make the Dr an ultimatum.

Also these:\n\nHonestly, if you want long term with this guy, you still have a lot of years left, then a fasting glucose is less than the bare minimim. Tests like an A1C would give you a better idea of his overall blood glucose levels, I doubt you are going to get him to test more often. An A1C is typically done every 3+ months and helps show progress too.\n\n10 pounds in a week is possible by losing water and weight but that is still lot so fast.\n\nHis fasting numbers are not crazy high, but you don't know if he is close or far for other times of the day, like after he eats.\n\nIf he does have insulin resistance, part of it is genetic, so sometimes a combination of meds helps. Not everyone can manage their diabetes to nondiabetic numbers without meds. Or some start on meds, get things going and can wean off.\n\nHow often are you (is he) checking his fasting BG, 150 to 140, so once a week? Even daily is one data point a day, BGs fluctuate a lot so more data helps get a picture\n\nThe green, yellow, red lists are super helpful, portions are part of the mix too.\n\nIf it was me, I would wonder why the doctor is such a no go. It puts a lot of the talking a doctor/nutritionist would do on neutral ground back into your court. He may have things like high blood pressure that can be treated, he probably has not had a basic checkup in a long time.\n\nEverything you did was great, I would make sure the goal posts do not move, 3 months is a long time for an adult who won't see a doctor.

I didn't have one initially either which I was glad for. Because I was so focused on researching and doing the work that that would be just one more thing to do which gets very overwhelming. I would say do the work. Just focus on that now. The glucometer is not so important. In my opinion. If you do the work then blood sugar has nowhere to go but down.\n\nBut the work does not only include food. It includes portion size also and how often you eat.\n\nI don't know if I'm repeating myself but it's very important that he stays hydrated everyday. That will help his blood pressure too. He also needs to make sure he's eating enough fiber. Huge for sugar too. What I do is I take one tablespoon of Chia seeds twice a day. You know exercise. Both aerobics and weights even at home. Stay active throughout the day and don't spend a lot of time stationary. Break it up. More than a glucometer a smartwatch was far more useful to me.

He also has to do stress control in whatever way suits him. He also has to find what his triggers are. For me it is fried foods, beyond 90° temperature and steroids. Sleep also is super important.\n\nThe good news is this is a healthy way of living. You should join the journey too. You don't have to worry about if you are diabetic or not because this is a healthy lifestyle that will help anybody. In fact the diabetic lifestyle is the lifestyle we should all lead.\n\nThe two biggest outcomes I got from diabetes is one personal growth.

Newly diagnosed in the UK. What can I expect?,"So newly diagnosed yesterday. My doctor got my first blood results Friday and rang to send me to Same Day Emergency Care which confirmed it all. Was a little concerned at the Docs warning that “some people become very poorly very quickly and that’s why they want to see you”, no idea if that’s the standard thing or not!
My HbA1c was 108 (12%?) and I didn’t really learn much from the doc there, just that all my other blood tests came back fine and normal is below 42.

Firstly it’s a relief to be diagnosed, had odd symptoms for a long while but did nothing about them until I lost 9kg (19.8lbs) in a few weeks, most of it seemingly muscle from my arms and legs, I look like a twig with a belly now! Also developed a raging thirst and was putting down a stupid amount of water, particularly at night. To be honest I never connected the previous symptoms of things like sudden crashes, tiredness and things to anything but this diagnosis explains a lot. 

My diet isn’t that bad, it’s balanced but I eat loads of everything and am overweight, another 8kg to lose. Was always fairly active until an injury in Jan but building up to gym and cycling again. I’m pretty much addicted to fizzy drinks and Monster so strongly suspect that may be to blame coupled with the extra weight. Cut those out almost completely in the last week and started to look at my diet already, also taken my first dose of Metformin and not planning on being further than 10ft from the loo all day!

The big question is what happens now?
Repeat bloods to check the dose I understand but will I see specialists, dieticians or am I going to be sent on my way after I see my doc Thursday? Beyond the near future and any help/advice is there any long term care or help available? Realistically how quickly do positive lifestyle changes take affect on the body? Is the fact I potentially had it for a fair while already likely to make it harder to deal with? And most importantly, do any of the treatments stop the thirst and consequent need to pee all night long as I want a full nights sleep?!?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14okepv/newly_diagnosed_in_the_uk_what_can_i_expect/,"[""Start reviewing your diet, cutting carbs (sodas, sweets, rice, pasta...)\n\nExercise regularly, don't go bonker.\n\nand control your weight.\n\nTake your medication, keep at it, the usual side effects go away after a few weeks.\n\nMeasure you blood glucose daily ( multiple times per day at the beginning)\n\nDiscuss with your doctor the blood glucose target you should aim for at short, medium and long terms.\n\n[https://www.diabetes.co.uk/type2-diabetes.html](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/type2-diabetes.html)\n\nFor me, the thirst and peeing nearly stop immediately as soon as I started taking medication and eating better; I even forget to hydrate during the day."", 'You\'ll have a few appointments with the doctor to check you are stabilising and checking what your finger prick tests are coming in at, checking on ketones if you have any.  Discuss if you are doing ok on metformin, if you aren\'t on ER probably switch it. \n\nAfter that it will be 3 month A1cs (blood tests, pee samples, foot checks, weight and height) and discuss with the nurses here, refer back to the doctor if the results need a change in med doses etc. \n\nI was NOT sent to an Endo, but they did C-peptide and antibody testing to be sure I was T2 in that first week.  I was given a finger test glucose machine, and have been refused a CGM because its this trusts policy that there are ""too many T2s, we can\'t give them to you no matter how many times you test"", something echoed in other areas by friends, but you *can* ask and see just in case. \n\nYearly you\'ll have a special diabetic eye screening to check for retinopathy. Remember to be able to get home safe after as they suggest you don\'t drive afterwards for several hours as it changes your vision because they dilate the eyes. \n\nYou\'ll be sent on - or pleas ask for - a diabetic education class. It goes through the basics of how the illness works, then spends the second half telling you everything fat and calorie is evil and to cut carbs and eat more veg. (take the high fat and calorie bit with a pinch of salt - you still need to eat enough and fat is actually fine as long as you aren\'t overeating. I had the issue I was *losing* weight due to the insulin resistance and struggling to eat more than 1200 calories so sat through that bit a bit dumbfounded as to what the hell I WAS allowed to eat then...). \n\nSince you have lost weight recently whilst your blood sugar is out of control its normal to gain a little back as you stabilise - don\'t think of this as failure! You can work on weight loss after stabilising and getting an idea of how different things affect you and what exercise you can or can\'t do. \n\n(note: diagnosed North East England, End of 2021). \n\nResults from changes: as your blood sugar comes down you should stop the peeing constantly and thirst almost immediately, at most a couple of weeks, but basically almost as soon as you start hitting regularly below around 10mmol on your tester.  You will feel TIRED though, if you\'ve had higher sugars for a while its exhausting at first to have normal ones and will take some adjustment, be kind to yourself and be prepared to take a few naps, be careful increasing exercise and ensure you aren\'t overdoing it at first and tell others at home you might be a bit low mood for a bit (but obviously try to control the snappiness)', ""\\> And most importantly, do any of the treatments stop the thirst and consequent need to pee all night long as I want a full nights sleep?!?\n\nYes that can resolve quickly - those two symptoms (really the same symptom) are a short term result of VERY high sugars. Your body is trying to push the sugar out (thus the pee.. which requires water intake to keep up with).\n\nIf you bring the levels down from the VERY high levels this will abate. The doctor won't let them stay that high long - they'll apply insulin if they have to. If they fail to do that you'll end up hospitalized with (at least) diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and/or pancreatitis.\n\nSo the thirst will  improve and the weight loss will also improve fairly quickly (in days typically).\n\nThe lifetime problem for most diabetics is high blood sugar.. less than those critical levels - but doing damage over time to your kidneys, toes, eyes, heart etc.. having elevated levels over time leaves you at high risk for blindness, neuropathy, kidney failure, strokes, heart attacks, etc.. serious stuff!\n\nSo you need to work hard (how hard depends on how bad your disease is which, just like cancer, varies from person to person.. this isn't fair. and typically it gets harder over time) with diet meds and exercise to get those sugars down to good consistent levels. 6.5% A1C is where you really want to be. 7.0% is pretty good. Some people obsess with healthy (non diabetic) levels of 4.5% or 5.0% but 6.5% is really where the correlations with complications begin - focus on getting there. This part won't happen super quickly, it will be easy to ignore (you'll probably feel fine with an 8.0% A1C) and will be hard to maintain. But it's important.\n\nyou got this. Don't forget exercise - it really helps but gets talked about less (mostly because the majority of patients aren't willing to do it)."", 'Your diet is very bad, if you are eating loads of carbs and sugar.

VA Doc put me on meds after lab work,"Hey y’all. I’ve been on metformin 500mg 2x daily for about a month now and really have no idea what I’m doing. The VA wrote me a prescription and gave me a glucose monitor—that was it, other than doc telling me to cut out soda and walk 30-mins. I rarely drink it anyway.

Anyhow, should my doc have given me more guidance? After reading some posts here, I really feel like the VA is nothing more than a bunch of pill pushers.

My a1c was 8.4 and fasting glucose was 190 when they did my bloodwork. The glucose monitor they gave me came with 10 strips and replacements were expensive. To cut costs I picked up one from cvs which had cheaper strips. Over the last month reads have been anywhere from 110 to 340.

When you were 1st diagnosed, was it a similar experience with your primary care? I’m wondering if I should just find a new doc outside of the VA Healthcare system.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14o9jc0/va_doc_put_me_on_meds_after_lab_work/,"['Many doctors know a Dx of T2 diabetes is hard for many patients to accept and fully understand and may actually limit what they say at the start.  If you continue to read this sub you’ll see the gambit from “I’m not taking meds, I can diet and exercise” to “I’m eating what I want I don’t care.”  Some almost go OCD on BG testing trying to understand every blip in their meter results.\n\nOften metformin is the first step in managing T2.  For some it’s the only thing they do.  Sounds like you are tolerating it ok and you understand the value in testing your BG.  Always test your morning fasting value as it’s an indicator or how well you are doing.  Testing an hour after meals gives you an indication of what specific foods may be causing your BG to spike.  Usually your doctor Will target a range from 70 to 180 for your BG sticks as an acceptable level.\n\nYour A1c tells your average BG % over about the prior 3 months.  As a T2 usually your doctor will target you below 7.0.\n\nTry to cut your carb intake not just sugar but potatoes, rice, bread, pizza, pasta, etc.  Try to increase your exercise especially after large meals.  Even short quick walks will burn glucose and lower the BG spike.  Work to reduce your stress levels.  Stress whether work, emotional or illness raises your BG levels.\n\nTesting your morning fast, prior to a meal and 1 hour after a meal in the beginning is helpful.  Ask for a larger RX on test strips.  Most insurance will pay for at least one strip per day.  Often more if you are on diabetes medications.  As you have found cheaper meters and strips are often available.  Walmart ReliOn brand is frequently mentioned.\n\nI know a Vet who uses the VA and he gets great care and was enrolled in a special online diabetics clinic for a while.  I don’t know if that is standard or was done during Covid but call your VA office and ask.\n\nKeep reading and posting questions.  There are lots of kind, caring and knowledgeable T2’s here that can help you understand how to learn to manage your BG.  Just remember it’s a lifelong journey to better health, not one and done.\n\nGood luck!', 'The doctors probably aren’t any better outside the VA. Diabetes is mostly a self-education situation. Similar experience. “Take these pills and come back in 3 months.”\n\nLots of good resources on the internet. I started with Sten Ekberg, Jason Fung, and Beat Diabetes! on YouTube. There’s also some good sites like diatribe.', ""My experience was similar. For T2 diabetes, I recommend finding either an endocrinologist or an internist for your care. Getting a meter with cheaper strips was the right thing to do. The cheapest is the Walmart ReliOn brand. I chose a Contour Next ONE, which is slightly more expensive but supposedly slightly more accurate.\n\nDiet and exercise will be your biggest allies. 30 minutes of vigorous walk a day can really help. It's even better if you can manage 20 minutes after each meal. You will get lots of ideas for food here. Most of it will boil down to cutting down sugar and carbohydrates in general, except fiber. Look at net carbs (total minus fiber minus a percentage of sugar alcohols). You'll need to figure out how low to cut carbs based on where you are. But you should avoid bread, potatoes, rice, and anything starchy.\n\nIf your BMI is over 30, you need to try to drop some weight. The exercise and metformin will help. Start tracking carbs and calories (I use the Carb Manager app). You may be surprised at how much you consume (I was). Getting used to smaller meals can help you. Having a calorie deficit along with the exercise will promote weight loss.\n\nAlso, see if your doctor's office has resources available for learning about diabetic diets. Be a little leary of some of that info.

As you know, the gallbladder stores up bile and excretes it when you eat fats so your body can break them down. Without a gallbladder, it is going to take some months for your body to figure out how to deal with fatty foods. Until then, they're going to go straight through you and nobody likes diarrhea, so your post-op diet is going to be Very Low Fat. That's it. That's the only real thing to worry about. Fortunately, that dovetails well with the recommendation diabetic diet: lots of veggies and lean meats.

Thankfully I have a history of being told incorrect information from doctors more than I have been told correct information, so I double checked the facts:\n\n1. Surgery has a fatality rate attached to it and lifetime complications.  Around 8% of people who get their gallbladder out have lifetime complications, a restricted diet, and they have to take pills for life. \n\n2. You can take ursodiol to dissolve the gallstone.  No surgery needed.  (There is an over the counter equivalent you can get too.)\n\n3. They push surgery on you because it's more profitable, not because it's the safer option.\n\nI chose to go the ursodiol route.  I went to a gastroenterologist, got a prescription for ursodiol and after 6 months the gallstone was gone.  No lifelong issues or risk of death.\n\nHow it works:  \n\n- When you don't eat enough fat in your diet the gallbladder isn't used.  If it isn't used for long enough a gallstone can form.  This is how most people end up with gallstones.  \n\n- When you have a gallstone you can't use your gallbladder, or the stone might get stuck in your gallbladder and you'll need emergency surgery, so you have to be on an ultra low fat diet right now.\n\n- When taking ursodiol it needs to replace the bile in your gallbladder to dissolve the stone, so you need to be on a reasonably high fat diet when taking ursodiol.  I recommend taking it right before the start of a fatty meal.  For me my diet consisted of lots of fatty red meat (ribeye, 20% ground beef), lots of butter, and most of all heavy whipping cream in a lot of dishes.  Eg, I'll make a low carb milk out of heavy whipping cream.  That and some other fats like cream cheese and what not.  This helped my gallstone get dissolved at a an accelerated rate.  For many people it takes 2 years to dissolve it.\n\n- Every 6-12 months you want to get an ultrasound to see if the stone is dissolved.\n\n- Once the stone is dissolved you need to stay on a high fat diet.  It doesn't have to be incredibly high in fat, just enough to use your gallbladder from time to time, or a new stone will form again.  Likewise, modern studies (anything past the 1990s) show healthy fats are fats lower in omega-6, which is most saturated fat.  If you eat a lot of saturated fat your large LDL will increase, which is the healthy LDL (small dense LDL is the bad LDL).  Your doctor may be unhappy with higher LDL and recommend a statin.  Always get your small LDL checked first before taking a statin.  If you have the healthy kind of LDL a statin can negatively affect your health.\n\nQuestions?"", 'I had my gallbladder out in 2010.

Confusing GC Readings on Libre FreeStyle 2 vs. Finger Stick,"I have been using Libre FreeStyle 2 monitor for some time now but the readings, most of the time, are completely different from my finger stick readings. For example, just this morning, here are a few of the readings to show what I am talking about.

This morning at **3:02 a.m**., reading with **FStyle2 was 160**. (I always need to go to the bathroom several times a night, so when I am up, I take a reading.)

Then at **5:02 a.m**., the reading was **175**. 

At **6:02 a.m**., reading of **155**. (This reading didn't make any sense to me as my glucose always goes up in the morning until I take my insulin shot.) 

At **6:15 a.m**. it was **190.** 

Because my BG went up 35 points in a matter of 13 minutes**,** I tested with a **finger stick** and it read **164** at **6:18 a.m.**  

I took my insulin shot (20 U of Regular and 18 U of N) and waited for about 45 minutes to test again. 

So, at **7:01 a.m**. the **FStyle2** reading was **164** and the **finger stick** was **184**. ???? I will ask my doctor about this, but I am concerned as to which readings were correct.

Question about meals and tips,"Hi everyone, 

I'd like to share this week's meal and blood sugar log. It's my first week in being consistent and I am hoping to get a clear overall picture. I see a nutritionist in 2 weeks and I am feeling hopeful to make a lifestyle change. I was wondering if I am testing at the right times and any meal suggestions for now? 

My last a1c was a 10 and this august I get an updated one. I am feeling nervous but hopeful.

New diagnosis and a lot to unpack ( AITA diabetic edition),"Forewarning: I’m in a VERY bad mood.  

 So after generally feeling like crap, constantly tired, ED, being overweight , low libido, blurry vision, and  a family history, I suspected my BF had diabetes.  We had multiple conversations about this for two YEARS.  He refused to go to the Dr so I got a meter finally and tested him myself;
150 fasting. Well! That’s just great.  I told him he had two options: do something about it or don’t do anything but I was not sticking around.  I watched a family member kill themselves by diabetes and it’s a hideous hideous death that was 100% self inflicted.   (By the time they passed they’d had both feet amputated and were in diapers because they had no control of their bodily functions and were nearly blind and in renal failure. )
He told me he’d eat what I told him to but he won’t see a dr and it’s my responsibility to do all his meal planning and prep and cooking and monitor his numbers. He says he’s too overwhelmed and depressed and I’m being selfish if I make him manage his own meals and numbers. 

Is this fair or is this insane? Im not comfortable acting as his dr and I’m a single mom, I can’t keep up with 100% of his meal prep. I don’t have the time.

Newly diagnosed,"Hey Reddit

Eventually, I trimmed out oatmeal and all the berries I had previously deemed OK to eat.  At this point, I'm not sure what else to cut.\n\nWhat did I eat?  As I said, I'm not a craver or emotional eater, so I'm OK eating the same things repetitively.  Breakfast or Lunch - scrambled eggs, sausage & salsa.  Variation - add peppers, mushrooms, bacon.  Lunch or Dinner - chicken salad, ham sandwich, turkey sandwich all on romaine lettuce leaves instead of bread.  Alternate with a large salad with lettuce, radish, celery, green pepper, black olive, cucumber, egg.  Variation - add cut ham, turkey and swiss.  For big / special dinners - steak, fish or chicken and vegetables.  For snacks I have worked fruit back in - an apple with crunchy peanut butter and I eat cottage cheese for something cold and quick.  Most recently, I've cut breakfast out and have gone to 2 meals a day.  \n\nIt's boring I guess, but I eat it and I'm not hungry any longer and it's over.  Repeat day after day and you forget about fast food and the other crap that was part of your diet.\n\nA grocery shopping trick that my son taught me was to shop around the outside perimeter of the store and to stay out of the inner isles.  Staying on the outside will get you fresh unprocessed foods for the most part (at least increase your odds).\n\nMy weight is coming off, but the most dramatic change has been my BG readings.  Now I regularly test between 90 - 110 after being caught @ 541 and an AC of 16.9.  Something in my system popped, not sure what happened or why, but I went from 7 something to 16.9 out of the blue.  \n\nMy improvement is, of course, not from diet alone.

Yes, I\'m still missing out on those pure-carb foods, but everything else is so tasty it\'s not *that* difficult to maintain. Change sandwiches into salads. If you are a pasta eater - focus on making really hearty sauces (like meat ragus) and serve on zucchini ""noodles""  so the pasta part is unimportant (something like zucchini noodles with marinara is a losing proposition for me). Get into meats you may not have regularly eaten to up your variety. Main course salads are great - Thai beef salad, Cobb salad, Nicoise salad, chopped Italian salad. I probably have 10 good recipes for chicken thighs. Make a lot of food for your dinners and have the leftovers for lunch. Oh - I also make and eat desserts - without fake sweeteners. I cut way back on sugar and use dark chocolate, almond flour, etc. I have some that are under 10 grams of carbs. I make ice cream that is low carb with all-natural ingredients! \n\nAs for the weight, what medication are you on and what are you doing exercise-wise?

I wouldn’t be surprised if a good number once everything is under control is more like 80g.\n\nYou don’t need to starve yourself with tiny portions. Cutting the carbs will help the most. Increasing the fat content in place of the carbs will help with hunger.\n\nIf you like pizza, I do a homemade keto cheese pizza crust that only has a few carbs and tastes similar to takeout. It’s mozzarella, an egg, almond flour, and some cream cheese.', ""If you haven't done so yet, you need to schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to discuss medication options, dietary changes, and set goals for your A1C. That is going to be very helpful. If your pirmary care doctor didn't catch this, it may be time to find a new primary care doctor. It is also a good idea to see if you can get a referral to an endocrinologist.\n\nI was diagnosed in January 2023 with an A1C of 7.2. I am 47(m) and weighed 320lbs. at the time. It was from a blood test I got when I went ot an urgent care of a different reason. I had been told previously that I was prediabetic, but given no advice on what to do abut it other than eat less and exercise more. I was not provided any information on how serious that was or how easy it is to go frrom prediabetes to diabetes. So I wasted time by not really changing anything.\n\nAfter I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, I had a brief 30 minute consultation with a diabetic nurse. She got me testing my blood sugar once a day and told me to follow the ADA dietary guidelines and that my goal for blood sugar was 100 mg\\\\dl. So I started with keep carbs to under 160g per day. My doctor prescribed 1000mg of metformin (500 mg twice a day).\n\nAnd my blood sugars remained high. I did some studying about diabetes and discovered that, at least for me, 160g of carbs a day was sure fire way to keep my diabetes progressing. I started to follow a low carb diet of less than 50g of carbs per day. This was very hard at first because pizza and nachos and rice and beans were all staple parts of my diet. I learned that carbs are not essential, but proteins and fats are. So I leaned into eating more protein and more healthy fats and kept my carbs below 50g per day.\n\nI started to see improvement in my blood sugar numbers. Still higher in the morning (dawn phenomenon) but getting lower. Testing my glucose multiple times a day (first thing in morning, just before a meal, an hour after a meal, and again two hours after a meal) to see what was going on, especially with the foods I was eating.\n\nI found that pretty much any carbs beyond the little in leafy green veggies or in nuts cuased my blood glucose to spike. At this time I advocated to get a CGM prescribed. Once I had that, I will able to track my blood glucose and see exactly what was happening, not just with the foods I ate but also how sleep impacted my number, how stress impacted them and more.\n\nI decide to go for the keto diet and keep my carbs under 20g a day. It took about a week for my carb cravings to go away. I was eating meat, cheese, avocado, leafy greens, and healthy fats like butter, extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil etc, but zero bread, pasta, chips, rice, beans, potatoes, sugar, sugary drinks, juice. And my numbers responded quickly.\n\nSince then, I have decided to a more meat focused keto called ketovore. Most days I am under 5g carbs (strictly from veggies and nuts) and I haven't gone above 20g in probably two months.\n\nI walk 6 days out of 7. I walk after work. (I work a desk job, so not much activity.) I try to keep my heart rate between 110 and 130 (the so called fat burning zone). I walk for at least 30 minutes. If the weather is crappy, I do step exercises in my house for the same 30+ minutes.\n\nI just had my first follow-up A1C post diagnosis. It was 5.6. I have lost 50lbs. My doctor cut my metformin dose in half. We are going to test again in December and if I stay int he normal range, we will cut out the metformin altogether.\n\nI say all of this not to toot my own horn (or at least not too much ;)) but more to illustrate that control of diabetes is absolutely possible.  Carb addicition is real. Some need to go cold turkey to break the habit, others can wean off over time. I found weaning off helped me. Seeing the positive results each time I lowered my carb intake just reenforced that I was doing the right thing for my body.\n\nIt does require lifestyle changes.

Here are some additional recommendations:\n\nDon't continue on as if you are undiagnosed. Ask to speak to a dietitian, a diabetes counselor, and as many other specialists that are available in your medical system or insurance network.\n\nOthers have mentioned to get a meter and supplies. Yes, but request this through your doctor. You may be able to do so via an email. If you already bought a meter, take the extra one to work. Data is your friend.\n\nAsk to have an A1C check set up regularly. Just because they *should* does not mean that they *will*. Also, get your blood vessels checked in your eyes, and similarly Ask them to set this up on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe medical system is set up well with information technology, but they do not leave their staff any time to review related information. Remember: always look for constellations of information and share them with your medical professionals. Figure it out. As an example, are you seeing another doctor for HBP or heart health? Tell them about your new diagnosis. Similarly, is there anything that you haven't taken care of but meaning to? Like maybe snoring?

Question about Hba1C and fasting Sugar,"Hello Everyone,

I am T2D since 6 years, I was diagnosed with DKA and A1C of 14. I lost my balance since then.

From 2017 to 2021 my A1C is always below 6.

From 2021 I moved to another country)the Netherlands) and here the doctors mostly always go with American Diabetics Association guidelines.

My last 6 hba1c (I do it every 90 days) are between 6.5 to 7. And fasting sugar is around 150. When I talk to Doctors here they are not ready change medication saying that hba1c upto 7 is okay per ADA.

I follow extremely low carb diet (<30g per day) and I can not go below that.

I am not sure how to approach this.

Edit : should I deliberately eat more carbs and increase my hba1c for the next test so that doctor prescribes another meds?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14mqfxa/question_about_hba1c_and_fasting_sugar/,"[""Ask your GP for a reference to an Endo.\n\nI'd also check your diet for hidden carbs."", 'I would try a different doctor.', ""Just be aware that a1c tests are not the same in the US as other countries.

Hydrochlorothiazide Question,"Hi. My spouse is t2. Diagnosed just this year after a heart attack. He’s on insulin and metformin. He’s been doing great on life changes while using treatment. A1C came down to 6 from 10 within 3 months. 

His bp has been going up lately (work has been stressful) so his cardiologist added Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide to his metro er and .5 Losartan he’s been taking. He started taking these new additions 7 days ago. For the past 3 days he has had a banging headache and his glucose kept spiking really high. It was 283 last night. This cannot be a coincidence because all was fine other than elevated bp lately. His glucose numbers were great prior to this addition. 

Last night he didn’t take the hydrochlorothiazide because we read online that it can elevate glucose. Today his headache is gone and glucose has came down. 

I talked to the cardio nurse about it and the nurse at his gp. I asked could this be connected and they both say it’s highly unlikely. They’ve never heard of anyone having glucose spikes from hydrochlorothiazide. So I thought I would ask others if they’ve encountered this before. 

It’s strange that he was feeling fine (other than elevated bp which he felt no physical effects of) and after starting the bp med additions he’s wasn’t.

Eyesight,"Hello all! I'm new to this subreddit, having been diagnosed about a week and a half ago with T2 Diabetes. I had gestational diabetes 20 years ago, but this truly feels like an all new ball game. I am currently taking Metformin and Ozempic and doing well with the new diet. Trying to learn SO much about this.

My question is about eyesight and diabetes. I've read that diabetes can give you blurred vision. Well, I've been wearing glasses since I was 16 (35 years ago), so my vision is always blurred and changing. I have progressive lenses, with 3 prescriptions strengths in each lens. Just to give you an idea of what I'm working with.

In the week and a half that I've been on the meds/new diet, my eyes have definitely changed. I can no longer see my computer clearly through the section of lens that I normally do. I put in my contacts last night, and I thought my one contact was a defect because I couldn't see well out of it. But nope, correct lens. And keep in mind I only got these prescriptions maybe 6 months ago or so.

My question is (and I know you are not doctors, but maybe someone has had the same experience), might this be from getting my blood sugar numbers closer to a normal level? I've never had a change be so drastic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14m8lh8/eyesight/,"['So if you’ve had a high average blood sugar for a long time once you start getting to normal, or at least significantly lower, vision can be impaired.

Woken up “low glucose” alarm!,"(Just diagnosed in March, no insulin) advice please! 

Just put this in all of the support chats I’m in, sorry for any redundancy.

Any advice to stop this from happening? I feel so weak and shaky and know I need to get up and eat but don’t have the energy, then wake up all groggy and out of it.

They have me on 1000 my of Metformin and just upped my Trulicity dose to 1.5 last week. Also on Vyvanse for Binge eating/ appetite suppressant.

I had a finger prick Libre, I could start pricking when the alarm goes off to make sure. I just feel like I can’t go down on meds if we’re trying to bring my A1C and weight down 😞 I was diagnosed at 7.1 and now at 6.0, have lost 15 lbs still 90lbs to go to my healthy weight. 

I don’t have any support right now, just my NP prescribing meds and my psychiatrist prescribing meds. I’ve been on the phone for hours and hours many days attempting to find a support group (virtual) with other people and my insurance won’t cover any.

Fasting glucose levels,"Hi everyone,

I’m kind of newly diagnosed and my doctor wants me to start monitoring my glucose levels at least a couple times a week. Last time I checked my A1C 3 months ago, I was at 7.9. I got it checked again today but the results aren’t in yet. I wouldn’t be surprised if it has gone up..

Concerned son needing some guidance.,"Long story short, my father is t2. He does not take this serious and still makes some bad choices when eating daily and with the drinks he has sometimes. He has not taken any of his insulin shots he says he doesn’t want to, that he’s nervous. I want to push him to change and better himself, but I just can’t.

Libre CGM: Very itchy at sensor application site. Tips?,"I recently started using the Libre 2 CGM and so far it's been... not a great experience. My first sensor kept waking me up at all hours of the night with false hypo alarms (it wasn't from pressure. the sensor was defective) so after a few days and after consulting with Abbott, I removed the first sensor and applied a new one. The false alarm issue is gone, but I've been having to take diphenhydramine at night in order to sleep because the application site for the new sensor keeps getting super itchy by the end of the day. I only have two days left before this one has hit 14 days so I'll be changing it again soon. 

Is there something I can do to prevent the next one from being so itchy? It really sucks having to pop Benadryl just to be able to sleep.

9 Months Post Dx. 4.9 A1C and 50lbs lost,"Just sharing the good news! 

Started at 210 lbs (M) with a 6.9 A1C. Immediately after diagnosis, I declared carbs my enemy and leaned heavy into keto with a caloric deficit to help lose the weight. 

Once the weight began to come off and energy levels returned, my fiance and I started walking, and have been doing so regularly each week. After the walking became easier and the weight started to drop more and more, other exercise did as well. 

I've leaned into weekly HIIT, resistance training, walking the golf course instead of riding, and even the occasional jog! 

I've managed to drop to 159 lbs and a 4.9 A1C! Super happy right now, especially being able to visibly see the results of the work I've put in. 

My challenge now is to drop my high LDL, which I understand is in part from losing so much weight and should be better with stabilization, but I'll be adding more ""better"" fat sources, and more fibre into the diet. I've also kind of moved to low carb where I've allowed myself a bigger variety of vegetables and nuts.

You have taken the first (and possibly most important) step in building your new healthy lifestyle.\n\nIf I may offer some small bits of advice:\n\n1. Don't expect immediate results. It takes time for the body to heal, so if you are not seeing dramatic changes right away it doesn't mean you will never see positive results.\n2. Use the CGM to figure out what foods cause yoour body to spike glucose in the blood. Check the reading before you eat a meal, then check it again an hour after and two hours after.\n3. Use the CGM to encourage yourself to maintain control. Before you decide that it is OK to have a high carb meal, check your readings and decide if that meal/snack is worht it.\n4. It is often better in the long run to make changes a bit at a time and make sure you can keep them up before changing the next thing. This isn't always the case for everybody. Some people need to do it all at once, but trying that for others jut means they will burn out.\n5. A daily walk of 30 minutes is a fantastic way to help control blood sugar and to lose fat. Several walks a day is even better, but a lot of that will depend on how you can fit them into the schedule.\n6. Hard/strenuous exercise isn't always better. Don't feel like you have to immediately become a triathelete. Walks are a great place to start. As that becomes a habit, add additional physical activities that you enjoy to mix.\n7. For most, lowering carbs is difficult. We have all been taught that we need to get 60% + of our calories from carbs, but that isn't true. Breaking the carb habit is a lot like breaking any addiction. One step at a time will reap benefits. If you can't cut carbs out all at once, try cutting the carb portions in half for a while. As your body heals, it will demand fewer carbs. Once you are comfortable at half portions, cut them in half again. Monitor how your body reacts with the CGM. It will tell you what you need to do.\n8. Don't beat yourself up for bad days or for slip ups. We are only human. Every slip up is an opportunity to do better going forward. \n9. Come back here for enouragement and to share success stories. The encouragement you get will help you make progress. When you do, sharing your successes can be the thing that helps someone else keep from giving up.\n\nI am sorry that this has happened to you. The good news is you now have a fantastic opportunity to get healthier, feel better, and enjoy your life more fully. You can absolutely do this."", 'Thanks.

"Type 2 on insulin, highly insulin resistant. A few questions.","I'm in my 40s and have been diabetic for quite a while (been on Metformin for maybe 20 years).

I've progressed through various oral treatments to finally insulin after having a bad case of pneumonia this past winter. I'm waiting on an antibody test to see if the sudden worstening of my blood sugar levels are more to do with lack of insulin production or insulin resistance, and to figure out why it was all of a sudden so much worse.

My internal medecine doctor is pertty open to my suggestions (asked for a c-peptide test but she did the antibody test instead after I suggeted maybe I had an auto-immune incident while ill for example). Insulin was also my idea after strict low carb and monitoring my Dexcom charts daily did not work to bring my blood sugar below 10 mmol/L average range after my bout with pneumonia.

Currently taking 60 units basal and roughly 100 units bolus to control my blood sugar eating fairly low carb with the occasional treat like a bun on a burger, berries added to salad, or sometimes a small serving of sweet potato fries with a chicken breast, pork chop, or piece of salmon for example... but typically it's a lower carb green veggie salad as a side.

Taking this much insulin should I be concerned with hyperinsulemia? I'd like to lower my insulin resistance but I have no idea where to start. Is there a test I can get to check the progess that my diet and exercise is making on my insulin resistance or should I not be too concerned because my blood sugar control is now great (5.9-6.2 AGP or projected A1C according to Dexcom.)

Should I get my internal medecine doctor to refer me to an endo? I have so many questions. I'd appreciate any advice on what tests to ask for (not asking for treatment advice like meds or anything like that but what I should ask my doctor? They should provide the decided course of action not me after all).

The antibody test was a good start, but a good endocrinologist will cover all the bases and find out why your condition has suddenly changed. As for the insulin, speaking from personal experience, you can still lower your insulin resistance while taking insulin. My A1C was a whopping 16.2 at diagnosis, so I needed to take insulin (long-acting), for several months until that figure came down and I could wean myself off of it. Also, there are much better drugs than metformin. I didn’t tolerate it well, but also it didn’t do a thing for me anyway, so I was put on Mounjaro first, and now take Ozempic. The GLP-1 antagonists have worked wonders. I’m off insulin now and my A1C is 5.6', ""I'd definitely seek an Endo. They are specialized to handle diabetes."", 'I was on glipside, metformin and insulin and my numbers were going up. I switched to a glp-1 and have had amazing results. Just something to bring up.', ""Agreed. \nI have had great sucess in managing my diabetes and have reduced my insulin to only some long acting. I am very insulin resistant. \n\nMy doc told me last month that mounjaro was being discussed in the diabetic field as a first line t2 diabetes med even before metformin!! I assume he meant all the meds in this class but he called out mounjaro. \n    \nSeeing an endo would be Op's best course as they will know about several potential meds that will help your situation. They may still want insulin as well in the beginning but that can be reduced or eliminated once you have contol and stable internal processes."", ""Thank-you for the insights. I will ask for a referral from her... I'm in Canada so I'm not sure if there will be a waiting list. I already mentioned Ozempic and she agrees, but wants to wait until the antibody test comes back first, something about it not being approved for Type 1 or LADA is it (the autoimmume adult version of Type 1). Mounjaro is approved in Canada but not yet available... it's my understanding that it adds a 2nd agonist along with the one for GLP-1 and is more effective (higher weight loss anyways in studies I do recall). Once I get my antibody test back I will have another appointment with her for the referral and to be put on Ozempic and possibly back on Metformin. She mentioned last time my lactic actid levels were up which is why I was taken off of it."", 'I’m glad to hear that. Mounjaro worked amazingly on me, but it’s so relatively new on the market that my insurance does not have it on their formulary, or at least without the preauthorization requirement. Given the price tag, the only reason I’ve been able to use it here and there is due to free samples and coupons given to me by my endo. When I don’t have a supply, I take Ozempic, which is okay, but compared to the control I get with Mounjaro, Ozempic kind of feels like a value brand. Lol!\n\nI hear that Mounjaro targets a broader class of receptors than only the GLP-1 receptors that other similar medications do, which is why it is more effective. My endo even said something interesting last time I was in her office. She used the word “reversal” when talking about it. That piqued my interest and I asked if she meant “remission”, but she actually meant reversal and said the medical community isn’t very certain about it yet and is still collecting data, but it looks possible, even likely, that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in some people with this drug and others like it.\n\nI personally believe if this class of drugs becomes the first line of treatment for type 2 over Metformin, it’ll present a sea change in how this disease is managed, and given all the sad stories I’ve heard of people struggling so hard for control with the more traditional approaches, it’ll be a much needed change.', 'Sure thing. Yes, Mounjaro definitely is the better drug for weight loss in my experience. I wasn’t even at an unhealthy weight, but managed to drop 25 lbs in the first 2 months I was taking it- enough to return my waistline to what it was in my 20’s. If it weren’t for my recent discovery of low carb ice cream then I might even have a fair chance at getting back my six pack! Lol!\n\nAnyway, the weight loss was an added bonus, but the amount of control I’m able to get on the drug is astonishing. Whenever I start taking Mounjaro, my sugars consistently stay within a range of about 85-110 mg/dl. I certainly hope for you all that it becomes available in Canada soon because it really is that good.\n\nOzempic is pretty good too. At least I maintain the lower weight when I am taking it, but the amount of control is somewhat less. I tend to average about 115 mg/dl while on it and that isn’t too shabby. I do have to stay more careful about my diet though because I have greater spikes when I am on Ozempic, but generally no higher than 150 mg/dl which isn’t too bad.\n\nStill, if I had my pick, I’d stick with Mounjaro. Regrettably though, my insurance refuses to cover it, so I’m only able to take the drug right now whenever my endocrinologist gives me some of the free samples they provide her.', ""We will be hearing much more about this type and the new ones in the treatment of diabetes. They are life changing for us diabetics.  I have difficulty with the idea of remission. Because it isn't a cure. It's like stopping blood pressure meds and the BP goes back up. Time will tell if it can be reversed. Certainly hope so."", 'So, a random question here. My doc put me on low dose ozempic mainly for the protective factors. 6 weeks on starter dose and the side effects got worse. Nausea and abdominal pain. I stopped it. Is there any comparable med that doesn’t have the sides that y’all know of? I’m suspecting they all do it but looking for others’ experiences.', 'That’s unfortunate. I didn’t have side effects like that, but I can see how a person might. For me, Mounjaro is a powerful appetite suppressant, so I imagine that I might have similar side effects if I took a larger dose than prescribed. Perhaps ask your doctor if it’s worth trying an even lower dose of Ozempic? Both drugs have a similar mode of action, so it could be that you’re more sensitive to a higher dose of Ozempic like I am to a higher dose of Mounjaro.\n\nOtherwise, there are a whole bunch of alternatives in this class of drugs. I only know that because I tried to argue with my insurance about covering Mounjaro when I couldn’t get Ozempic due to shortages. They suggested a whole list of alternatives (but still refused to cover Mounjaro 🙄).', 'There is a daily oral version of the same GLP-1 agonist called Rybelsus that may work better for you. Worth asking your doctor.', 'Thanks for reply. I was on the lowest dose of ozempic so it’s not possible to go lower. 🤦🏼\u200d♂️ I’ve got a list of them he recommends but looking for anecdotal experiences.']"

Type 2 in remission question,"I'm hoping to get an opinion, I'm a type 2 diabetic classified as in remission (diagnosed at 9.4 A1C in 11/2022, last test was 5.6 in 03/2023). I've been off of metformin for about a month and a half as I had a couple of BG lows and my Dr told me to get off of it.

A1C Update,"90 days ago my A1C was 9.4 and my doctor wanted to increase my metformin and add another medication.

IR- I'm down in the dumps,"Hey everyone,

This may sound somewhat stupid, but I feel so massively duscouraged from life since I got the diagnosis ""pre-diabetic/insulin-resistent"".

It just feels like I get punished for what little pleasures I have. I work a Ton, Studi on the side, i'm about to move, take care of my mother and help my sisters who both have a lot going on in their lives. 

It's stressful but I was far from unhappy -actually the opposite. Things were going quite well, a lot better than in the past.

Anyway, I realized that some things were off with my body and had the vague idea it might  be my blood sugar and yep, Iwas Spot on. Currently having around 110 mg/dl fasting sugar on average. 

I'm 32, overweight and the way I eat Was generally good (lots of wholegrain, verggies,  lean meat, good oil and  fat fish). BUT: Due to my job I eat very irregularly and often substitute meals with sugary energy drinks to keep up. I also eat way too much chocolate as a reward (no crisps, other Soda, cookies, etc). I'm normally also too tired for sports. 

My Doc was basically mad at me with little understanding and blamed me a lot for not taking better care of myself. She told me to immediately quit the Energy drink/sweet drinks generally and chocolate max once/week. Diet variations with sweeteners other than sugar are also rubbish as they indirectly worsen glucose absorption so I'm not allowed Diet Coke to at least somewhat Soften the blow from quitting energy drinks (i had about 1,5l/day of it).

I changed everything the way she instructed me to and I feel crappy. Not necessarily physically, but mentally definitely. Food is no fun. I know how to cook and I like what I eat, but its still no fun. In the world we live in, it feels like 85% is a no for me while everyone else digs in. It feels like enjoying is forbidden, theres always the worry if it's too much, is it going to spike my levels too much..
It's hot as heck and people enjoy ice-cream, cold drinks/Juice, etc and I sit here with my water. Had spinach and fish for dinner and that's it, tomorrow another 12 hour shift and there is that. 

Don't laugh at me but I'm starting to feel depressed.  Doc says I must be very consequent or diabetis type2 will be my ( rather soon) future which I absolutely want to avoid.

I know I have to Lose weight and be more active but instead of comfort, food has just become another worry in my life that I didnt need, I have enough.

And yes, I eat Fruit, but it gives me nothing taste wise.  I also don't like fats and replacing  carbs with a degree of fat is difficult, full-fat milk, yoghurt and meat taste aweful imho.

This ended up to be a vent, but nevertheless I'd like to ask how you dealt with this situation? 

Thank you for reading",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14itd46/ir_im_down_in_the_dumps/,"[""Honestly I feel the same.  I really never enjoyed eating, which might sound strange as I'm diabetic now.  I was on anti depressants in my 20s, I've learned how to live with that.\n\nAfter many years as an adult I settled on a diet that seemed (in my head) to be pretty healthy.  Nothing I ate, beyond cereals for breakfast, bread maybe twice a week and boiled potatoes would really seem to cause diabetes, but here I am.  \n\nIts sapped what little joy I had from eating, I'm back to eating what someone else has decided I should eat, like living with my parents.  It can be a little hard to not feel like you are being punished.  For me, my work colleagues eat horrendous diets, and I have to watch that.  Feels very unfair.\n\nI've changed a lot, but I'm surprised you can't have diet drinks.  I'm allowed pepsi max in small amounts, but I mostly drink water, green tea and decaffeinated coffee without sugar now.  \n\nYou are lucky you got diagnosed before crossing over to t2 fully.  Take the opportunity to make changes."", ""Here come the down votes for me...\n\nYour doc is mostly right. Pounding sugar is never ever going to be a good choice for maintaining health in the long run with diabetes being only one of the issues to deal with. Same goes for no exercise. IMO we just dont like the fact that we now are forced into having to deal with it and make better choices.\n\nYou can either blame your genetics or blame your culinary choices. I am still moderately pissed off that I cant eat what I want when I want but I'm in this situation because of those choices so... Straight up I wish I was only pre diabetic.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what I do 95% of the time:\n\n* Coke Zero but try not to pound it down it's almost as unhealthy as normal coke\n* Water, healthy or not it's the substance of life so try to drink 1 liter per day\n* Walking, if you're as stagnant as me (software engineer) then ANY amount of walking is going to have a positive impact. After a lot of reflection on myself I now understand that my reasons for not doing it were nothing other than excuses. Aim for 2 x 10 min walks per day and you'll see a change.\n* Resistance training, I keep a set of dumbbells next to my desk and use them in meetings. I'm still fat but my arms look great.\n* Milk is high in sugar and carbs whether it's full fat or not so go for 2% and just go easy on it. Fairlife milk is 50% lower in both.\n* There is keto chocolate and ice cream, sure it isnt as nice but less amputations down the road if you eat those instead.\n* The only thing I truly miss is bread, pasta, and french fries. I do eat keto bread but minimal as it is still spikey on the blood sugar. I also eat french fries once in a while, maybe twice per month but usually only when my BG is under 100 and I keep the rest of the meal low carb.\n\nIf you're treating food as comfort them I highly recommend you get some counseling. It was for me too and it shouldn't be. I still treat myself to some things but it's a once a week once per month thing, not daily, and I typically wait for low blood sugar before I do e.g. If I'm around 80ish then I might make myself a latté without guilt.\n\nBottom line is I have sympathy for you but only so much. This is your wake up call to not end up like some of us where EVERYTHING we eat has (should) to be thought about before hand. You're still in a place where minimal changes will still have a decent impact and likely prevent progress of this disease whilst still being able to have the odd treat here and there.\n\nThis isnt the end of the world, it's a new beginning and I highly recommend you look at it this way and keep this in mind: You can recover from this and prevent further progress with moderation. Most of us look at food and it spikes our BG. Get yourself a glucose meter and start seeing what hits you hard. Nothing like real data to help you make decisions!\n\nIn closing, the above changes had me lose about 50lbs, a drop from 12.5% to 6% a1c, and I  feel way better than I did a couple of years ago."", 'One thing that stood out was that full fat tastes bad. I went low carb and now everything full sweet tastes disgustingly sweet. I’ve lost almost all interest in carbs. Full fat took a minute but now I prefer fat to sweet in general.

I’m not sure there’s a way to do chocolate without a lot of portion control.\n\nAs far as the worrying aspect, I went low carb right off the bat so I could figure out how to control my numbers without having to feel like I was doing a constant balancing act. If I don’t get adventurous, I don’t have to worry about my numbers. Is it a little boring? Sure, but the challenge now has been finding acceptable replacements for high carb dishes. Some are almost indistinguishable from what I remember. Others are close enough.', ""Lifestyle changes suck.  For the time being, you do need to take control of your diet and lifestyle.  One thing you can look forward to is once you are in a healthy place, your body will be more well adjusted.  You can treat yourself in moderation and it won't be as hard to regulate/recover.  Now, when I think about something that I liked to eat in the past, I wait for an occasion and also tend to make sure I make the most of it (no low quality carbs).  If I'm going to consume carbs or sugar, it had better be worth my trouble.  \n\nAre you on any medication?  not that it's any consolation, but a lot of T2D medicines tend to lower your appetite too."", ""Yes.

I promise you the changes will make you happy. I know I had a very unhealthy relationship with food. It was literally one of my hobbies. Baking, cooking, eating out...it was social and relaxing for me. I was surprised to realize that once I adjusted my perspective I could still do all of those things. \n\nSimple changes with a huge impact, cut out the sweet drinks. This change alone dropped 35 lbs off of me. Replace at least half of your liquid intake with water. There are a lot of low carb drink options, Gatorade Zero, True Lemon, and Minute Maid has a bunch of juices with zero sugar. Not drinking all of those carbs means your body can afford to eat some more healthy ones. \n\nLet me preface this next part by explaining that I am lazy. No excuses, I just am. So once a week I cook a tray of chicken breasts. I chop them all up, put most of it in single servings in the freezer and keep one baggie in the fridge. I thaw them daily and make a ton of different meals with them and it takes almost no time at all. Add some soy sauce and veggies = instant stir fry. Add some marinara, veggies and cheese = chicken parmesan. Add alfredo sauce and broccoli = fettuccine. \n\nSnack ideas that may help you: low sugar jerky, nuts, cheese, olives, pickles.

Question about exercise and BG levels (learning still),"Hello all,

Within 10 minutes of post-workout, I went down to 156-159. Happy to see that considering it wasn't 2 hours yet post-meal. But now I just checked and it's 162. Why did it go up some? Will it go back down and lower?

But then after dinner, even if the meal was balanced, I\'ll shoot up to 160-185 and then it won\'t always go down enough when I\'m sleeping despite the night insulin. So strange!

Any way to make testing with lancets nicer or easier?,"I've recently started using a glucose monitor after being diagnosed with T2D a few months ago and am already sick to death of the lancet poking.

Marriage issues?,"This is probably way more than a diabetes related post, but did the diagnosis affect your marriage? I've been struggling a little before have but now I'm in control of my eating and becoming more activity minded. My husband, has not. I just don't feel like we have a lot in common. We both work and have children. He is always talking about tv shows, movies, and making me watch videos from Facebook or you tube or whatever. I'm busy paying bills, meal planning, shopping, exercising. I don't have time for those things and I don't care about them. I have really been reevaluating my life and realize I have less years left than I have already lived.  I know maybe I should relax more but relaxing looks differently now. It's going for a walk or a swim. I ask him to walk with me after dinner and he always has an excuse, which is mostly he doesn't want to.  We are heading out of town for a funeral in a beautiful city. He said, ""afterwards we can go eat."" My thinking is, ""afterwards we can walk around downtown. "" Yes, that might include lunch but I can no longer use food as entertainment. If we eat lunch, I want to walk but he will say it's too hot. Or whatever so he'll want to eat and then get back in the car and drive home 2 hours. I just can't do things like that anymore without feeling like crap. I am no longer willing to sacrifice my health just to be compliant. He's supportive but it's just me on my own doing it, which is fine but if I'm going to be doing it on my own, I want to do it all on my own, if that makes sense. Not have to worry about if I'm leaving him alone to exercise or planning a meal he will also like. Things like that. I was just on a week vacation with one of my children and while I still had the responsibility of my child, it was the most free I've felt in a long time. Any advice? Words of wisdom?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14i9swk/marriage_issues/,"['First of all, one can absolutely enjoy food and have diabetes. Making healthier eating choices has not impacted my love of food or eating at all. I love cooking and going out to eat\n\nHaving said that, this is typical mid-life crisis stuff in marriage. Get yourselves to couple counseling if you want to ""save"" your marriage or see if you can have a happier one. People grow and change, and not always in the same directions.\n\nDon\'t ""blame"" this on diabetes ... this is about drifting apart. Diabetes doesn\'t cause that (or cure it)', ""One person can not be all things for you. You are changing in a variety of ways, he may not be changing in the same ways. We aren't going to go on all our journeys together. Do you have any friends you can walk with? A running group? A support group? Are there other things you still connect with him about? Maybe focus on the things you still connect with him about and go do the other things on your own or ideally with other people who want to do the same things."", ""Have you spoken to him about this? You may really need to sit down and really talk this out, it seems like he's trying to connect with you in his own way and your hobbies and interests are more health minded. Maybe marriage therapy can help too with a proper mediator and you and your husband can come up with a compromise. \n\nBeing diabetic doesn't mean you can't sit down and watch a show with him weekly. Or you can do home exercises while watching with him like jumping jacks or doing squats every commercial break. You can both go out to eat and do a quick ten minute walk to walk off the meal. If you need him to step up in terms of emotional labor like groceries and meal planning for the family, you should tell him. My partner is nondiabetic (I'm the cook) but I always keep frozen food and meal prep meals for him to warm up himself and eat if he doesn't feel like eating the low carb meals I make. \n\nActually now that I think about it, I wonder if it's an emotional labor issue going on especially since you both work and have kids. https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/"", 'When you feel like you\'re the one doing all of the responsible stuff it can be really...well, less than fun and quite frustrating. Also, being diagnosed is just so much mentally and physically. You have to remember that this is your diagnosis though, not his. So he may have no idea just how hard it is for you.\n\nIs it possible that you two aren\'t ""hearing"" each other? I know my husband and I have certainly done that before. We were listening to reply to the other, instead of hearing. Been married 21 years. We still have to work out ""the bugs"" sometimes. You start at one place together but if you don\'t grow with each other, you grow apart. Toss some in some kids, bills, etc and you have full blown chaos in the house.\n\nThere are definitely always two sides so make sure when you are talking to him about it that you do so clearly and with kindness so he can understand how serious this really is for you. If all else fails, maybe consider some marriage counseling? \n\nNo matter what you choose, I certainly hope you two work it out. Much love to you today.', 'It\'s possible you\'re being overly restrictive in your version of healthy eating.  That\'s quite common in diabetics, especially newly minted ones who haven\'t shaken off of their old preconceived notions of what\'s ""healthy.""\n\nFor example, if I have to eat out with friends, I\'ll typically just get a ribeye steak or a plain 80/20 burger patty (maybe throw in a salad with no dressing or just olive oil if I\'m feeling fancy).\n\nIf you previously ate ""healthy,"" there\'s a good chance you may have certain preconceived notions of saturated fat, macronutrient goals, or calorie goals that will cause you to object that eating that all the time is unhealthy or will cause you some other problem.  Or maybe you have moral or ethical objections or believe in greater societal implications of such food choices.  To those I would note that your previous dietary paradigm was what ultimately got you to diabetes and it\'s very possible that as you do further in-depth research your personal opinion of ""healthy"" may change quite a bit from where it was before you had to confront diabetes.', 'The grass may look greener on the other side, but typically because it is being fed by a sewage pump. Talk with him about it. See a counselor. You dont want to walk away.. that just brings more issues.', 'There is a lot there building up. Something has got to start relieving the pressure, or it\'s going to erupt like the San Andreas Fault.\n\n**My first suggestion is to step out of the framework that** ***he*** **is the problem**, and if he would only do X, Y, and Z everything would be fine.\n\nFirst of all because he is a person with his own wants, needs, and preferences which are just as valid as yours.\n\nAnd second, because that framework *turns you into a victim*. You are just a leaf flowing downstream with no agency. That thinking blocks you up. If *he* is the problem then all you can do is sit there and wait for him to change. And that leaves you frustrated and helpless. And it can lead to depression and losing hope.\n\nSo, all of this goes in the trash: blaming him, finding fault with his choices, expecting him to change, trying to argue him into submission. He no longer has to change. You do.  Not because this is your ""fault"". We are removing blame and fault finding from the equation.\n\n**In it\'s place we bring in a new priority:** ***possibility***. How we got here isn\'t as crucial as what we can do to get through and to the other side. I know this might sound airy-fairy. But how you frame this really is your choice. It can be the story of how everything external is blocking you and you are powerless to overcome it. Or, it can be a story of using the intelligence, compassion, and creativity inside you to open a door that previously wasn\'t there.\n\nThe first step is to just talk. This is a conversation where nothing else is going on. You have each other\'s full attention.\n\n**Tell him what you are** ***feeling***. No one can argue with you feel - you are the world\'s foremost expert on that topic. This is just about your experience. Don\'t blame him, don\'t tell him what he did wrong, don\'t give him a list of things he needs to do differently. Solutions can come later. Right now you just want to give him the world through your eyes.\n\nOnce you have laid it out, **ask him to repeat back in his own words what he has heard**. This is crucial. We can easily get into a rhythm where we are only half listening because in our mind we are preparing our own arguments. No, you each have to listen and then tell what you have just understood the other person to say. Being heard is maybe the most important part of the process. How much of a burden would that lift just knowing that he *gets it*. He understands what you are going through. If he misses something come back to that, and then have him tell you what he now knows.\n\n**Now reverse the process. Ask him what he is feeling**. How has this time been for him? Is he angry about something? Does he resent the new regimen you have to stick to? Does he miss the carefree person who used to go do fun things with him? Listen carefully. And, again, pay particular attention to how he *feels*. Feelings are more important than events or circumstances. Make a note because you will want to come back and try and address these things.\n\nBut first, when he is done, it is your turn to give the feedback. Tell him what you have just heard him say. Let *him* know that he has been heard.\n\nEven if you were to just stop here, you are so much farther along than you were before. You can each see what each other is struggling with. You now have both your and his points of view.\n\nCarrying on. **If he brought up things that you did or said that hurt him, ask his forgiveness** for both what you did, and the pain you caused. Intention doesn\'t really matter here - you probably weren\'t trying to cause him pain. But, it happened. And hurt is hurt regardless of the other party\'s intention. And if it is unresolved, then it will remain a road block. This is just standard relationship repair. Apologies and forgiveness are the oil that keeps marriages going. Otherwise you would just build up a list of resentments until you explode.\n\nHe may see a way that he hurt you and might want to apologize. Some people know how to take responsibility for damage they have done, and others don\'t. Don\'t hold it over his head if he cannot at this point.\n\n**Finally, it is time to bring up possible solutions.** Some people can do all of this in one long conversation. Some people do many conversations. However this is not a one-time thing. This is a new communication habit. This is what you can do when there are tough things to say.\n\nBut whether you are tackling this in the moment, or giving each other some time to think and then come back to it, now you are ready to get creative.\n\nWhat *will not work* is for you to come prepared with a solution that you want him to implement. That is a return to ""if only you would do X, Y and Z then everything would be fine"". This is something you will put your heads together and come up with. When you do that, then you both own the solution - it\'s not a battle of wills as to who is going to submit to whom. Also the old adage that two heads are better than one is true. You can both creatively come up with actions that individually you would have never considered.\n\nPay particular attention to what he told you about what he feels. Work to address those issues. And pick out a couple of your issues that are either top priority, or such low hanging fruit that they are easily addressed. Again this may take multiple conversations, but work it through piece by piece if necessary.\n\n**The bottom line here is that you are a family - a single unit going in to the future together.** Yes, there are your needs and his needs, but you also want to see *our* needs. What are our priorities and goals and how can we get there from here.\n\nHa-ha - well no one every accused me of being concise. I hope there is something here that helps. Take what works and feel free to discard the rest.\n\nWishing you both the best.', ""Sounds like there needs to be some compromise otherwise you'll end up like me, very single and for the most part happy.

You\'re about 5 months into diabetes so far.  I\'m sure the first few months were an initial freak out period (like we all go through).  Before, eating healthy was a more abstract concept, like eating less chocolate or choosing whole grains.  You heard different random things and tried to start doing it if the person telling you those things sounded like they knew what they were talking about.  Now it\'s much more concrete and getting it right actually matters in a more meaningful and immediate way.  What I\'m telling you is that if you continue to read and explore different dietary theories, your views of healthy eating will likely shift and evolve in very surprising ways.  If you put in the work to do this, the you of 2025 will very likely look back and think that the you of today was hopelessly naïve.

My bad cholesterol was up, and the good was down.  What a mess!  I started on metformin about six weeks ago.  My goal is to have a lower A1C at my next blood test in six weeks.  My method is to cut out the low-carb fake foods and get back to eating appropriate portions of meat and vegetables.  Like others here have said, I took off the blinders and looked at what I was doing to myself.  Diabetic complications are real, life altering consequences of staying on the road to self-destruction.

Everyone takes time to adjust and learn their way around this new world.\n\nThe good news is that, unlike many other disease diagnosis, you can actually do something about this. Stopping the effects (and in some cases reversing the damage) is very possible.\n\n*The Diabetes Code* by Dr. Jason Fung and Nina Teicholz is a classic book on the subject. It explains what diabetes is and how it works, and then what you can do to stop the damage, and actually become healthier than you have ever been in your life.\n\n**My 1-2-3 Diet Changes**\n\nHere are three easy to remember steps to get you new life off the ground.\n\n**1. Eliminate:**\n\n* Sugar\n* White Flour (bread, pasta)\n* Potatoes\n* White Rice\n\nThese are the biggies. If you do only this, you are 60% there. *Don’t go cold turkey* \\- do it in steps. Cut the portions in half the first week, then half again the following. You don't want to take away the joy you currently have in eating. And even when you are going full speed ahead, it's OK to have a couple of your friend's french fries or a bite of birthday cake. (Not at the same time.) You will still get to taste your favorites, but you will have new favorites for your nourishment.\n\n**2. Eat only small controlled portions of complex carbs:**\n\n* Oatmeal\n* Brown rice\n* Sweet potatoes and squash\n* Beans\n\nThe difference between this list and the first one is that these actually deliver important fiber and nutrients, rather than just empty calories. However, they are carbs so you have to go easy and watch your tests during the day to see how your body handles them.\n\n**3. Replace the missing space on your plate with vegetables**\n\nCooked vegetables, frozen vegetables, salads - there is no reason to be hungry, just swap the empty carbs out and these in. Keep your meat/protein portion the same as before. Resist the temptation to double up on the meat to replace the missing potatoes and bread.\n\nThat’s the starting point. Do this, add some exercise,  and you are on your way to health again. You can then fine tune with your glucose meter readings to match your specific metabolism.\n\nI have another great book recommendation. *Diabetes Cookbook and Meal Plan for the Newly Diagnosed* by Lori Zanini. It assumes you are overwhelmed, and explains what is going on and what needs to change. Then it gives you a four week plan for easing into this new world. It helped me a lot."", 'I use a lot spices and cook a lot of ethnic foods, so that’s an easy thing to take over thankfully.

Things you thought were healthy might not be healthy for you anymore and vice versa. \n\nI can\'t even begin to tell you the importance of ""pairing"" your food. Try eating in this order: clean protein/healthy fat (chicken/fish/avocado/eggs), veggies (avoid root veggies), small amounts of healthy carbs. Protein slows down digestion (and keeps you full) but veggies keep things moving. When you eat stuff like fruit, opt for things like apples and berries. They have a low glycemic impact while bananas and juice will send your glucose skyrocketing. Lots of water. LOTS!\n\nThings I have to completely avoid are regular bread, rice, dried fruit, potatoes, sweet drinks, junk food, cereal, bananas, etc. Snack ideas: low sugar jerky, tuna pouches, nuts, cheese, whisps, pickles, olives.\n\nFor me personally, I wasn\'t eating a ton of junk food, I was eating way too much fruit. Get your portions under control and you will find not only do your numbers look better but you will feel better.\n\nYou can totally do this.

Weight melts away during the first few weeks. He does a good job explaining how the macros affect your body. The most eye-opening thing was finding out that dietary fat and cholesterol don’t affect your bloodwork numbers like triglycerides and cholesterol but carbs do.\n\nOne thing about cutting carbs is making up the calories elsewhere. Lean meat probably won’t be as satiating as it was. You’ll need to increase your fat intake to pick up the energy that carbs were providing. But it’s ok.

Use a scale or known pre-portioned amounts, but you'll also be surprised how 2/3 cup cooked rice or 2 oz uncooked pasta is plenty alongside your sauces, meats, veggies.  \n\n\n+ _daves killer bread or ezekiel bread, carb-counter tortillas and josephs flax pita breads._  These are all low carb alternatives to full carb typical bread products.  You may prefer to cut them entirely - after all, many of us stop eating pastries, cakes, donuts etc, so it can be done with bread too - but if you can't quite put up with no way to eat sandwiches, tacos, wraps 'normally', these are all good ways to reduce total carbs and glycemic load vs typical. Just pay close attention to serving sizes on those. \n\n\n**I hated hearing it, so I hate repeating it to others, but its the truth: diabetes and pre-diabetes cases are highly individualized.**  Your needs, tolerances, and specific obstacles *will not be identical* to someone else's.  However, some broad trends as pointed out by others:\n\n\n+ Several major studies show drastic improvement when prompt action is taken to significantly reduce carbs and, if possible/warranted, weight as well. You will see a lot of overlap with Keto diets in the advice pool, and that's why.  **Your limits may vary, but the golden rule is - the fewer carbs, especially readily-absorbed carbs like wheat, sugars (including lactose and fructose), and potato starches - the easier it will be for you to bring down your blood glucose levels and keep them down.**  The same studies also show that bringing down your A1C quickly along with weight loss (if applicable) significantly reduces the chance of progressing to diabetes or suffering complications from diabetes.  \n\n\n\n+ Light exercise soon after a meal can reduce the glucose spike duration and intensity. \n\n\n+ if you have carbs on the plate, push them to the last part of your meal.  You shouldn't be eating carbs on their own, pair them with protein always. \n\n\n\nLast bit of good news, its never been easier to track your exact intake.  I use MacroFactor, but many use MyFitnessPal or other programs.  They have huge databases of food and recipe calculators too.  Get a cheap food scale, and be honest with your tracking method, and in a few weeks you'll know what your given carbohydrate and/or protein goal looks like.  You'll be surprised how high carb the average diet is, and how much you can cut out without even really missing it. \n\n\nThat said, you WILL miss something, and you will feel weird or bad or angry. These first weeks are the hard part, but remember - **it's not a moral failing that got you here.**  You don't have to feel bad- your body doesn't work like other people's (and only time will tell on the particulars of your needs), and your mission is to find a new way of doing things that DOES work for you. In that way it's no different from an allergy.\n\n\n It may be that you will have to make more changes, or take medication, even though you're doing everything 'right'.  **It's also entirely possible that, in the long run, not much will change, and I hope that's how it goes!** But this is why its important not to moralize the diagnosis - changes to diet and exercise are a form of *treatment*, not simply 'clean, simple living' or whatever, and if they aren't enough, that won't be your fault either.  **Do the best you can**, get qualified advice from medical professionals, and keep an open mind - your first attempt at 'lifestyle changes' may not work like you hope, so you have to be willing to try again.   It's always worth trying again, even if you have to show up here from time to time to vent first.  ***You can do it.***"", 'I’m honestly not sure.

The honeymoon has been over...,"... and I'm struggling to get back.

When I was diagnosed almost 2 years ago I was very inspired, became super strict and brought down my A1c within two A1C results. But I couldn't hold that strictness because I was too strict so I let go a little bit but my numbers didn't change that much. I however was careful not go over the top. Then my numbers went to the normal levels and after a few A1cs the doctor allowed me to go off metformin.

Last December I just let go completely, but avoided my trigger foods. I stopped exercising, stopped working on my stress, stopped drinking enough water, stopped eating enough fiber. And my A1C has been rising with every A1c. 

For some reason yesterday I was inspired to really become careful again. Meaning just start on my lifestyle changes. 

So all I did was just start drinking water. I even bought myself a new 64 oz water jug, and I started drinking. I drank as much as I would usually do when I was diagnosed. Just that surprised me this morning my usual morning sugars dropped significantly.  I had cheated yesterday and had a slice of bread and small part of a chocolate birthday cake. But along with the chocolate cake I drank four glasses of water over a period of time slowly so I didn't keep running to the bathroom.

I was shocked that just drinking water had such a big effect.

So imagine what would happen if I started the other things that I usually do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14hxcd7/the_honeymoon_has_been_over/,"[""It is surprising how quickly your body adapts to changes.

What the heck happened?,"Hi folks, I need some insight from you, please. 

I was diagnosed T2 in January with an A1C of 10.9. I took it seriously and completely changed my lifestyle.  3 months later, my A1C dropped to 5.2.  My average at-home finger sticks went from an average of 180 to 110.

Yesterday, I tried a few spoonfuls of a keto hazelnut spread I found on Amazon.  Big mistake!  My blood sugar spiked to 210!  I immediately drank a bunch of water and went on a 30 minute walk.  Here's the weird part: one hour after the 210 reading, I did another finger prick, the result? 68!

I thought it was a mistake, so I replaced the batteries in my meter, changed to a new pack of strips and tested again...same result.  I've NEVER dropped this low.  Luckily, 2 hours later, everything went back to normal.

Different Spikes for Different Folks,"I know several diabetics and it's always amazes me that despite diabetics usually are supposed to be on a low carb diet, different carbs will have different effects on different people.  


For example, my mom who's T2D diabetic will vary rarely have rice (even basmati rice), mango, watermelon, and bananas, because it makes her blood glucose go up. Meanwhile, she will eat yogurt and ice cream (not the low sugar kind) with no problem. Sometimes going for 2nds and 3rds.  My father when he was alive, also a T2D, he could eat rice, fried foods, and ice cream with no problem, like a decent amount.  But bread, soda, juice, bananas, candy would make his blood sugar go up.  My stepmother, also a T2D, there are do many things she can't eat, even the stuff that's low carb/low sugar.  A former coworker who is T2D, he could Ramen noodles or any Asian noodles with no problem, but candy, soda, coffee, juice, and potatoes, couldn't eat. 


Then I see people who I would believe there are diabetics because they seem to eat everything a regular non-diabetic does and in large amounts, but they say their blood glucose is always in the safe levels.

Testing new food,"So, I tested a new food today, and my meal was still balanced, but I was wondering if, from y'alls experience,  if your BG is a certain number 30 mins after, then lower 1 hr after, that the spike is over?

Could I really just have one really high carb meal a day and walk two hours afterwards?,"Hi all.  I'm diagnosed type 2.  I recently got a CGM from a relative and it has been very interesting.  It seems with the worst meals (especially juice and soda)  I spike to about 320ish about 2 hours post meal.  Fasting I am usually around 115-130ish.

I recently did an experiment and had a Deluxe combo meal from Taco Bell (1 cheesy Gordita crunch, two taco supremes, 1 chips and nachos -- needless to say MASSIVE carbs) as well as a DIET Mt. Dew.  I then walked pretty vigorously immediately afterwards for 1.5 hours.  To my utter shock I noticed that during this time my glucose never went above 150 and was still within the green range on the Libre app!

I did notice that upon slowing my pace and definitely when stopping the glucose started to shoot up a bit and eventually to 240ish.  Now during this time I kind of messed up and didn't properly hydrate with water (I know now to fix this).    I am also on Farxiga (which dumps glucose out in your urine as a means of reducing glucose in the body).  So I suspect if I properly hydrated myself the effect would have even been better.  I also quit after 1.5 hours but I could have easily done another 30 minutes and probably not had any real spike at all.

But my question to you wiser and more experienced people, is this really a viable strategy?  To just have one horrible meal a day and then literally walk it off for the next two hours?  If I really keep my glucose under say 160 the entire time does this really mean I managed to totally negate any negative effect on my diabetes due to such a meal?  Or are there other long term things happening too?  Note: I know such a meal obviously isn't healthy overall.

Two hypos in two days,"Hi all.

Not newly diagnosed per se, but newly taking medication. After 3 years of ignoring the diagnosis I am now under GP care and managing things with medication and blood glucose monitoring. 

Week one was 500mg metaformin and 40Mg Gliclazide after breakfast and evening meal.
Week two 500mg metaformin and 80mg Gliclazide after breakfast and 1000mg Metaformin and 80mg Gliclazide after evening meal.

I had a review Tuesday and was asked to take 1000mg Metaformin after breakfast  and I have a prescription for Dapagliflozen that I will start when it is delivered.

So on Wednesday about 10 am I was so tired I had to go back to bed . I set an alarm for 11 am as this was when I was due to take post breakfast blood glucose test as well as the fact I am working from home so really I could only be absent for an hour. I slept right through the 11 am alarm. I have never slept through an alarm in my life. Never. I woke up about 13:30 and got straight back to laptop and started working. I wasn’t hungry so I was not bothered about lunch just yet, but I just had an inkling something was wrong based on how exhausted I felt and the fact I slept through the alarm. Did my bloods and it was 3.8.
So I was told anything under 4.0 is a hypo. I drank some icing sugar dissolved in water and took again and it was 5.1. Ate two rich teas and got it to 5.8 which is well out hypo range. By 4pm I had to go back to bed as I was exhausted. No further lows that day.

Today same thing happened . So exhausted I had to go to bed, woke up at 13:00 and took bloods and it was 2.8, which again is hypo. Drank icing sugar water and ate lunch  half  an hour which took me up to 12 one hour after eating and I’m just waiting for the two hours to be up to see what it is doing now. I think I need to stop taking the extra 500mg at breakfast . The diabetic nurse is calling me on Tuesday so I can explain to her then that this has been happening.

I’m also desperate to go back to bed. In three weeks I have gone from lunch time bloods being 10-13s to the lowest of 2.8.

What’s your experience with getting your blood sugar down?,"My blood sugar got out of hand last month when I was sick (I was also getting off of ozempic around that time too, just couldn’t handle the side effects). I was getting readings in the 300s.

For two weeks now, I’ve done at least 30 minutes of cardio every day, often 45 minutes, and eaten fewer than 25 net carbs each day. 

But my numbers just aren’t where I expected them to be. In the morning I’m around 170 and 2 hours after eating I’m anywhere between 130 and 140.

I would’ve thought 2 weeks would be enough to get back into better readings but maybe I’m not being patient enough.

In 2020 I got my A1C down to 5.3 but that was after a few months of eating keto and exercising more.

Just wanted to get some other folks’ experiences. Thanks!

I don’t know the exact answer. Jason Fung is the man to check out on YouTube. He has an analogy with a cup representing the liver and water being glucose. Each time we eat carbs, we are adding water to the cup/energy stored in the liver. When it’s full, it spills over and that represents excess glucose and a higher blood sugar. Basically, he says that if we never fast, we never really deplete the glycogen stores in the liver. By fasting, you are allowing the liver to unload some stored fuel but it takes time. Fasting makes a lot more sense when you look at it from the hunter/gatherer days where feast and famine were a part of daily life. We have never had a stable food supply as a species until very recently.\n\nI’ve also read some overinflated balloon analogy where the liver goes crazy dumping glucose as you prepare to wake up because it’s jam packed with stored energy.

A1C at 5.2% after stopping metformin,"

Hi everyone. Wanted to share some good news. 

I (31M) posted on world diabetes day last year when I got diagnosed with T2 with an A1C of 8.3%. I was 310lbs and 6'4"". Started taking 1000mg metformin once a day. I stopped taking it once I got to 5% 3 months back. I was really nervous that my numbers would be back up because of that and I also had a bad month or so where I splurged more than I should have. Thankfully my latest A1C is 5.2%. Here is my journey: 

Nov 14th, 2022 - 8.3%
Dec 23rd, 2022 - 6.6%
Feb 2nd, 2023 - 5.4% 
(reduced metformin to 500mg)
Mar 23rd, 2023 - 5% 
(Stopped metformin altogether)
Jun 21st, 2023 - 5.2%

I cannot insist how important a CGM was for me to keep my levels in check. There were weeks in the middle where I didn't have it on and I noticed I always eat more unhealthy stuff when I don't know my glucose levels. 

Secondly this sub helped a lot. Will continue the good fight along with you all. Thank you. 

Thirdly, I have been stuck on 285 lbs for a while now and my weight loss definitely slowed down without metformin. I was a little more determined back then so I am sure it wasn't the only factor but the pace of weight loss was really nice with metformin.

Checked blood sugar levels and was at 4.1,I usually only check my fasting numbers 2x (as I have expires strips and I can't afford new ones at the moment) I had a 2.5 hour nap after a small breakfast (with my toddler as she only sleeps with me right now) (I take 1000 mg of metformin at this meal usually). I decided to check where my sugars are because I felt pretty normal turns out it was 4.1- which is low (I am used to the gestational diabetic readings where you're aiming for 3.9 - 4 )  so I was surprised that my one touch said it was low.

Worried sick about my mother,"Hello, so I’d like to start by saying this is mostly me venting, but I’m open to support and suggestions. 

My (25f) mother (59f) was hospitalized last week for high EVERYTHING. Blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, you name it. Her A1C was 13+. They brought her levels down in the hospital, sent her home, and increased her insulin dosage.

Today, I tried to call her and she wouldn’t answer two calls an hour apart. I live an hour away but I was about to drive to her when she called and said my cousin called the ambulance for her because she took the insulin on an empty stomach and then went to sleep and woke up with a blood sugar of around 40. She’s kind of scatterbrained in that way (I’ve always wondered if she had undiagnosed ADHD, but she doesn’t really believe in that).

She’s been a diabetic for almost my entire life. I don’t know how I can help her or what I can do. I’ve been preaching about taking care of herself for years and there’s always an excuse. It used to be she was “busy raising me” and now it’s “her stressful job”. I even tried to get her to join me when I lost 40 lbs after being told I was pre-diabetic. I reversed my situation and I want her to do the same. I hope it’s not too late.

I’m just so scared for her and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any siblings, and although we weren’t close, my dad died last year.  If I lost my mom, I would lose my mind. I don’t have much other family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14fvvck/worried_sick_about_my_mother/,"['Unfortunately trying to save someone from diabetes is about the same as trying to save someone from addiction.

I wear one and so does my dad, and my mom and husband have an app that alerts them if our sugar goes high/low (obviously it alerts us too). If she’s that bad at dosing her insulin, there are even insulin pumps that that will dose based on her blood sugar. This is all assuming she wants to get better at this and wants you to help her manage her health. If she doesn’t want to take charge of her health, that is unfortunately not a decision you can make for her', 'Sadly, what you want is not the same as what she wants. \nMaybe she could get some diabetic education classes. But you have to suggest it and she has to want it.', 'I think one answer is that systemic change, like diet change and weight loss, is really hard. I spent my entire adult life telling my diabetic mom to take better care of herself and to lose weight. She would always scoff and say that didn’t work and I would get so frustrated. Now, at 49, and obese my entire life despite diet after diet, I see how a lifetime of trying can make you feel like nothing works. I can remember my mom trying a LOT of diets when I was a kid, but the weight always returned. By her mid 50s she kind of gave up. Honestly, I feel that way a lot lately as I near that age.\n\nI think my point is that lifestyle change is super hard and proper medical help is what she really needs. Has she seen her regular doctor recently? I’ve never taken insulin, but my understanding is that it is difficult to deal with and it causes weight gain. If she needs it, she needs it, but maybe other medicines could help too. Could she possibly be put on a GLP-1 like mounjaro to help with diabetes and weight loss?\n\nI’m sorry you are going through this. I know how scary it is to worry about your parents.

My mom actually had a few episodes of being pulled over by the cops for dangerous driving and disorientation from low blood sugar while driving.  She was lucky that the cops recognized it was a health thing and not drugs or alcohol. \n\nMy sisters and I sat her down and essentially did an intervention, told her how her behavior was stressing us out, how she could potentially not only kill herself but anyone else unlucky enough to be in her vicinity. We were actually pretty harsh about it. She got a new endo and repeated diabetic education and she's better about testing but she still refuses to make dietary changes. It breaks my heart but I had to let go of it and be satisfied that she's at least not endangering others. \n\nI truly wish you luck with helping your mom.  But please make sure not to let the stress of it hurt your own health. The sad reality is that we can't save someone who isn't willing to save themselves :("", 'I understand and I’m hoping it does send a message. This is the worst it’s been as far as I know.

She tried to get a CGM monitor a few years ago and insurance wouldn’t cover it. I’m wondering if she could get one now after these incidents but otherwise they’re really expensive. I know after my aunt had a stroke they let her use one for 14 days for free and I think that would at least give her time to see patterns.', 'Thanks so much for this response, it really helped. She has tried fad diets like NutriSystem and Weight Watchers but with those as soon as users decide they don’t want to pay or subscribe anymore, they’re needing to find healthy choices on their own. Plus, they’re really weight focused. I don’t necessarily think she needs to worry so much about losing weight, but just general self care such as going for a leisurely walk, taking her meds, and eating 3 square meals. In reality I know very well her diabetes may not go into remission, especially this late in life, but I just hope she gets better control over it and finds a routine that works for her.\n\nShe did see her regular doctor a few days ago and she’s now on Lantus and Mountjaro. We are wondering if the insulin dosage may have been too high but she originally went into the hospital with a blood sugar over 400, so I can see why they’d prescribe so much. \n\nI really appreciate being understood.

I was not heavy as a kid but became heavy after working as a long haul truck driver. The struggle is real and it isn\'t always about ""oh, that person is wolfing down chips and coke all day long!"" I think metabolic syndrome is more complex than that and some people have a heck of a lot harder time with it.

New to this and I suck at it.,"How often do y'all check your blood sugar? I am T2. Haven't really changed anything, but my A1C dropped 6 points in 6 months.

6.2 A1C,Monday I had Lab work done for the first time since moving back to Texas in Feb. My A1C was 6.2 the last time I had it done was Sept last year in NY and I was off my metformin for 2 months and was having to do OTC insulin for 6 weeks and couldn't afford to do it every meal. The Dr told me that 6.2 was to high. But I thought it was pre diabetic and my A1C has only came up a few points since it was 5.9 in September.

7.6 to 5.4 in four months,"Diagnosed in February (after years of avoiding the doctor, so probably undiagnosed for at least a couple years). Thought my life was over. Immediately changed my diet and started exercising more, in addition to going on a low dosage of Metformin ER and a statin (high cholesterol, too, yay). 

Just had my A1C checked again and I’m in… “normal” range?! I’m so happy I could cry. I’ve lost 43 pounds, my lifestyle is pretty different, and all other test results are good too (except high platelet count—can anyone tell me what this means lol).

What works for me may not work for everyone but here’s what I do: Calorie deficit, limit carbs to 150g a day (started with 100g, but I allowed myself to go up once I stabilized), intermittent fasting (16-8), try to go for more whole foods (and I’ve been vegetarian for years), walk at least 8k steps a day, often much more, paired with exercise (stationary bike, strength training, and workouts). I’m not so good at keeping the stress down and regular sleep schedule, but trying. 

I definitely have “looser” days and meals—I still eat out sometimes, and travel is always a different beast—but trying to keep to those guidelines most of the time and testing after riskier meals so I know which foods absolutely kill me (rice! 😩) has overall been good. 

I still have even more to go—would like to lose another 40 pounds and get my A1C and fasting glucose down even more.

I went in for my 6 month checkup today expecting the worst...,"And instead I had my lowest A1C reading ever - 5.0. 

I was diagnosed with an A1C of 13.7 in December 2021. 2022 was a bit of a rollercoaster as we tried different meds, and I tried various things like exercise and diet and low carb and restricted calorie and I was generally just miserable and depressed. My readings were around 7, then up to 10, then down to 6, and then today I hit 5. 

Thing is, I don't feel like I earned this at all. I eat less than I used to. I've lost 50 lbs and I'm still losing. But my diet is pretty poor. Fast food a few times a week which includes fries and breaded chicken. A small bowl of soup for lunch usually, which has probably 20-30 carbs in it. I've had cookies. I just took a week off work to binge a new game and I was the worst diabetic you can imagine during that week. I ate things like Doritos, a sub from a sub shop, a casserole filled with carbs, etc. I'm eating like half of what I used to because the meds I'm on cut my appetite down, but still... the quality of what I'm eating...

I'm just in shock. How can I be this low? Don't get me wrong - I'm ecstatic. My eye doc was super happy with my progress as well (had some vision problems), and I couldn't understand how his diagnosis was so good either, considering what I've been eating. 

I'm currently on 1000mg of Metformin, 4mg of Glimepiride, and and the standard dose of Rybelsus (which is a semaglutide and i think the key to my success), daily. I eat pretty much what I want, within reason, though the key is that I just don't want anywhere near as much as I used to when I eat. I go for a short walk in the evening but that's all I've been doing for exercise. 

I was dreading this appointment so much, but turns out I'm doing just fine.

You leave out lots of other important information.\n\nIf you are eating a decent to high amount of carbs (in my experience, anything over 30-50 grams per day), then the metformin helps to remove that glucose from the blood stream.  However, if you are eating keto, and have been for a while, and don’t have much glucose in the blood stream, then the metformin suppresses your body’s natural ability to release some glucose from the liver in order to keep your blood sugar at safe levels.  If you are on metformin, but you also go keto and eat less than 20 carbs a day, then the metformin can push you artificially low and make you sick.  I have experienced this many times until I learned that you don’t want to mix metformin and keto.  Do one or the other.\n\nAlso, for long term health benefits, you *want* the glucose released from your liver, as long as you aren’t eating too many carbs and putting excess glucose back *in* your liver.  Diabetes type 2 is generally caused when you’ve eaten so many carbs (while being genetically predisposed) that your liver has started to store excess glucose in the liver itself, giving you fatty liver, and eventually damaging your beta cells.  If you go keto for a long time, (adding in intermittent fasting helps too), then over time the liver will release its excess glucose into the bloodstream, and will become less and less fatty.  If your liver stops being fatty, then it will stop doing any further damage to your beta cells.  So while you still may have diabetes type 2, you will at least stop making it worse.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, just try it for yourself.  Get a CGM and test your blood sugar on a regular basis on keto, on metformin, and on both.  Test your liver function repeatedly over time while on keto/IF and see if it gets worse, stays the same, or gets better.

Exercise and naps are the answer?,"[ preface: diagnosed in March at 6.8 A1C, cut processed carbs significantly, upped my exercise, down ~20 lbs ]

I’m noticing a pattern with my glucose readings - seemingly related to exercise, lowered stress, and rest - wondering if others have similar experience:

1) Weekends, so I’m not working and my stress is significantly less
2) Cycling 30-35 miles, usually both Saturday & Sunday, sometimes longer with my cycling club
3) Immediately after exercise readings in 140-150ish range (not sure why? adrenaline?)
4) Low-carb breakfast (eggs, breakfast meat, berries…)
5) Nap - usually ~2 hours after the ride, 30-60 minutes napping
6) Post-nap glucose ~100 (today was my lowest ever at 95)

So i did an A1C test..,"Came in at all time low 4.8! (since i started testing at diagnosis a couple years ago)

I am dealing with a kidney stone which is not causing any pain yet but in the process to find that out, i had a CT scan. 2 years ago i had bad fatty liver with a lesion. Fat on my pancreas as well. In my new scan, both of those have completely resolved.

They say, you can only restore beta cell function by resolving those issues combined with catching it early. I think i have. Now, i have one more blind spot i need to get checked and that is my fasting insulin. I'm going to ask for that at my physical in a couple months.

This 4.8 A1C covers a period of time that included a one week cruise where i abandoned my keto diet and did not do IF. I did not eat as much as I would have prediagnosis but i did indulge. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. I had biscuits & gravy, bread with dinner and desserts as well as alcohol every day. We also had two days in New Orleans where i had everything you would want to try in cajun/creole cuisine. Nothing spiked me. My highest post dinner reading was 129 and it quickly plummeted.

I know the word ""cure"" is extremely divisive here but i'm choosing to believe it's possible. I worked very hard over the past two years. Lost 60lbs (now 180lbs - 6'3"" tall). I'm mostly strict with my diet, exercise and IF but it is not a challenge to me anymore. I actually really enjoy this lifestyle so this can and will be sustainable for me. I was totally expecting my A1C to be in normal range but i expected elevation after 10 days of indulgence. Like something like a 5.3 or 5.4.

I'm really just wondering a couple things. Did i cure myself? Or was i possibly misdiagnosed? Can you have high A1C (9.1 at diagnosis) and not be diabetic?

UK based help needed,"In January I was diagnosed with type 2

I was told about lifestyle changes and diet.

Since then I've had no contact from my GP, I called today and booked in for a blood test.

I always seem to have to chase up my GP about most things and I struggle with that

Is there schedule I need to adopt i.e 

How often should my HbA1c be checked?

Is there other things my GP should be doing in relation to my type 2?

I will be putting these questions to my GP but thought I would try and get as much information as possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14djjdv/uk_based_help_needed/,"['*I think* that you should have your A1c test about every 3 months for the first year. \n\nThis will tell you (and your doctor) how well medication and lifestyle changes affect your diabetes.\n\nAnd after that, yearly, especially if your diabetes is under control.\n\nAlso, you should test your blood glucose on a regular basis, once or twice per day, again, more at the beginning to see how food is affecting your blood glucose.\n\nWith regular blood glucose testing you can **estimate** your A1c with the following formula on this site (one among many)\n\n[https://www.nutrisense.io/blog/how-to-calculate-a1c](https://www.nutrisense.io/blog/how-to-calculate-a1c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, my current 3 months blood glucose average is 5.4 mmol/L so the estimated A1c is around 5.1%; my last official A1c test was 5.1% (march).', ""Did you get a blood glucose monitor kit?

Told them I’d manage it via my diet. Narrator “she did not manage it via her diet”.\n\nI still had the annual blood work done though and they would call me up and say it’s worse than the year before.

Although I’ll save boring you with the saga on how I was to test 6 times a day with only 59 lancets and needles and not allowed to even think about a new prescription until the end of June. \n\nAnyway my point is my GP practice was passive but so was I. Even now they haven’t given me any leaflets or advice. You should also be invited to the DESMOND course or similar equivalent. Bear in mind you’ve only got 10 mins in a typical GP appointment and you’ll most likely have a diabetic nurse. I am quite happy as I already know a lot about diabetes I just chose to ignore it. If you can read Jason Fung, there is also a JF Reddit too. There is a UK diabetic society that has some rather old fashioned chat rooms and blogs and things. You should also be invited each year to have your eyes, feet, urine, weight etc tested. Follow this up if you don’t get an invite. \n\nYou have a choice to now try and reverse and put your diabetes into remission by adopting a LCHF diet/OMAD or carrying on eating your current diet and potentially progressing to more and more medication potentially leading to insulin.

I've moved since then and my current GP really couldn't care less, and I really have to take the lead in my managing my own condition.\n\nFor your HbA1c checks, only your GP is going to be able to order those anyway, so I would speak to them directly and ask the question.  So often GPs forget that patients aren't *also* dealing with 100 patients a day with the same conditions, so just forget to tell you information that they feel is obvious.  Unfortunately, you *have* to ask, even if it seems like a stupid question.\n\nStandard practice in the UK currently is an annual review for your diabetes, usually in the month of your birthday.  As a new diabetic this might be different, which is why I'd recommend asking your GP directly how often you need to get them done.  Don't expect your GP to chase or remind you; I wish they did, but mine certainly doesn't.\n\nYour annual review will usually be an appointment with a nurse who takes bloods, urine sample, blood pressure, pulse, and checks your feet, as well as taking all your measurements.  My experience has historically been really varied with these checks; sometimes you'll get a nurse who's really switched on to diabetes care, and they're great and really supportive.  9 times out of 10 though it's just someone ticking boxes, and it can be a not particularly helpful experience, imo.  For example, every year I get reminded that losing weight is important to diabetes care.  This is *after* they've just recorded that I fall into the frequent exercise group and noted that I have *already* lost weight.\n\nAfter that, your results will take a week or two to be processed and then they'll be reviewed by your GP.  Once again, depending on how your GP operates, this might then involve a follow-up appointment or not.  At my good GP, I *always* had a follow-up, even if things were all good, just to talk over my condition with my GP.  At my current GP they don't even get in touch with me unless there's a problem with the results; I check them through the NHS app myself.\n\nSo, long story short, your experience will vary depending on your GP, so I would go in and ask all these questions at appointment; figure out what they expect you will do, and what you should expect them to be doing.  I love the NHS, it's an amazing service, but it's stretched to breaking right now and unfortunately diabetes care is *exactly* the sort of service that begins to suffer under these conditions; if nothing is going drastically wrong, they'll just let you drift along until it does.\n\n**General diabetes advice**\n\nThere's loads of this everywhere online, so I wouldn't want to repeat it, but some stuff I've found useful is to focus on small improvements.  Maybe you've got iron willpower and can immediately change to a perfect diet and exercise routine, but I know I certainly don't and didn't!\n\nAs a new diabetic, the main thing I would focus on changing is understanding carbohydrates and how big of an impact what you're eating will have on your blood sugar.  The only way to do this is by checking your blood sugar frequently; that's *not* an HbA1C check, but a finger-prick blood test.\n\nI have a friend who was recently diagnosed diabetic and my understanding is that the NHS no longer gives out finger-prick testing kits to T2 diabetics, which, as far as I'm concerned, is diabolical.  There's no more useful tool, IMO, for understanding your condition and what changes you can make to help deal with it.  Thankfully, you can buy your own and it's not *crazy* expensive; you may even be able to convince your GP to put your test strips on prescription as well, if you're lucky!\n\nOnce you've got a blood glucose testing kit, start using it and recording the results (modern kits will sync with your phone to do that bit for you!), and use that to figure out how different foods and activities work for you.  For example, I am *always* high in the mornings, without fail, regardless of what I've eaten the day before.  I only know that because I test my blood sugar fairly regularly, but now I make sure to eat low/no carb breakfasts, to try and keep that from spiralling out of control.  Equally, I figured out that I can handle some carbs in my evening meal without much trouble, provided I make smart choices.\n\nI obviously don't know your lifestyle, but mine was pretty terrible when I was first diagnosed, but making small changes and repeating them consistently has been the only way I've made progress.  I often feel like I'm not doing enough, but the people in my life remind me of how far I've come and I really have turned things around, just by consistent small changes over a long period.\n\nThis has turned into a bit of a ramble, but if you've got any questions feel free to post them and I'll try and answer from my own experience!"", 'I definitely agree with Missy. If you don’t take an active role while you can , the harder it is going to get. I had a similar experience in the US. The doctors could couldn’t care less with a basic diabetes diagnosis these days. It’s far too common.  I did all of my own research and realized that low carb was the only way to get this under control. The sooner you start the sooner you can manage this - I was able to get off all of the meds and I now just manage with diet. It’s not always easy but the meds are not even that effective and they have side effects.']"
What Kind of Food is Easy to Digest?,"So two months ago, I got a new doctor who decided to put me on Trulicity to manage A1C and, after an experience I thought was too unnatural for someone on Trulicity (vomiting two days in a row, real bad diarrhea, I swear I felt chest pains as well during that week) my doctor instead put me on Rybelsus. Now it's been a month so far on this stuff and, while things are slightly better, I still suffer vomiting which, annoyingly happens almost TWELVE hours after I eat.

I have diabetics in my family telling me I'll get over this or that I just have to eat less and I don't know how less is less since I already skip all but one meal of the day/am starting to be SCARED to eat food at all. I hate how my stomach just won't settle down ever since going on this medicine and I want it to stop fully! I looked up food that apparently I have to avoid while on Rybelsus and that seems to be everything that I used to eat whereas the food it wants me to eat is food that's gonna make me sick anyways.

I would have one atkins shake a day to bolster calories, protein and vitamins but still took only a sip or two when I would have those few bites. That month was awful. \n\nAbout a week after I was at my destination dose (had to work my way up to it) my body started to chill out. I stopped being nauseous constantly and started reintroducing healthy foods back into my diet.\n\nChicken vegetable soup was one of the easiest things for me to eat and I could make it in my crockpot. Avoid adding potatoes and carrots. Toss in things like cabbage, onions, celery, zucchini, bell peppers etc. Cooking them slowly helps soften and break them down so it will be easier for you to digest. Make sure there is plenty of chicken in it.  Clean protein like chicken and fish will calm your body, give you energy and still keep your glucose under control.\n\nMy husband saw how sick I was and started boiling chicken for me in batches which has been something I do for myself now. I cook them ahead, put all but one back in the freezer. Then I can thaw them as needed and they are ready for salads, sandwiches, or whatever I want.\n\nOther snack ideas that are fast: low sugar jerky, nuts, egg bites, whisps, dill pickles, olives, meat/cheese roll ups. If you want some fruit, make sure to pair it with protein but stick with something like apples or berries which have much less of a glucose impact.\n\nI wish you nothing but the best.  Hopefully some of this helps you.', ""Another few things I'm also wondering, is the internet and even my diabetic family members are telling me skipping meals is bad, is that at all true cause eating once a day has been how I've been trying and failing to handle the vomiting.\n\nAlso as I'm waiting for my shift for work, I'm starting to get burps that, ever since I started taking these medicines, usually indicates that I'm going to be throwing up today.

Dinner's my favorite and, even before I got on the new medicine, was sometimes my only meal of the day by choice and I don't like having to wait for my dinner to get cold to handle this medicine.

I seem to be able to eat a warm dinner fine if it's a certain amount but I don't know what that certain amount is and have lately just been sometimes overshooting that limit that I can't figure out.""]"
"There's no Rant/Vent flair, I am so annoyed with this disease!","Diagnosed T2 in 2016. Maintaining well on diet, half-dose of Metformin (250mg), and some exercise. And suddenly, my bg is all over the place. Not high. Low. 

F*ing lows, going under 80, when I start to feel shaky and just cr*ppy. Weirdly, happening after I have a cup of fresh strawberries, which just came in season and which I love.

But it also happened after a fairly balanced dinner of Thai food, with lots of veggies but also lots of carbs. By bedtime, I was ravenous and starting to shake. Bg testing in the 80s. Didn't bother to go to bed as I'd lay there with stomach growling and get a hunger headache. Instead, I got up, had some chicken and a whole wheat tortilla and more berries on cottage cheese (net carbs about 25g).

How to help someone that doesn't want to change or be helped?,"My roommate of 7 months has been diabetic for about 5 years and is in her late 30s. From what I see at home, she drinks mostly soda and milk, and eats mostly chips, ice cream, pizza, and ham & cheese on white bread. She used to eat a fair amount of bacon too but hasn't for awhile. She also smokes multiple cigarettes per hour when she's not sleeping or working, and even then she sometimes gets up in the middle of her sleep to smoke. I guestimate her BMI is in the overweight category but not quite obese (or maybe just barely above the obese threshold). She doesn't exercise but I think she walks a moderate amount at work. She occasionally eats a banana or some veggies but definitely not enough to balance out all the unhealthy stuff.

My mom is a retired nurse practitioner and I formerly wanted to go into a health profession and have a science education, so I hate seeing people kill themselves through their diet and lifestyle choices.

I've tried asking her why she eats like that despite being diabetic, tried telling her that she can go into remission and probably save a lot of money on meds. She doesn't seem completely stubborn or apathetic about her health. I feel like deep down there is a part of her that wants to get better but it's just easier to not change. I told her once that smoking on top of being diabetic and overweight puts her at high risk of developing heart disease within the next decade. Not sure if she really heard me say it, but I don't really want to say it again because it would probably just upset and frustrate her. But I feel like she needs a major wake-up call like this to realize she has to change something before it really is too late.

Lifestyle changes ! Is my diabities reversed.,"28 M here 180 lbs 174cm

So long story short, since last 5 years my lifestyle have been shit ( lot of booze  1 pack,ciggs and we*d everyday, anxiety issues, shitty sleeping shedule and lot skipping meals, total inactive,and unhealthy processed food ) . I used to be university level powerlifter till 22 but then things changes. 

For last 2 years i was having some of the issues (like repeated yeast infection, Slight ED, numbeness in finger , etc ) went to doctor and my fasting level was 200 !! (That was like 3 months before ) He put me on metforfin and one more med) 

That was moment for change for me and i complete changed myshedule to below 3 months back and quit taking my medicine 

-I started jogging and being physically active (15k steps a day minimum) 
-From binge drinking 12-15 times a month i reduced it to 1-2 times a month. 
-I quit smoking ciggs ( i do vape and blunt here and there)  and improved my sleep shedule alot ( sleep at 11 and wake up at 6 and then long jog for an hour ) 
-my food choices have completely changed and elimnated sugar, fast food and simple carbs to eating lot of feshly cooked healthy food 

Since last two months i check everyday and my fasting blood sugar is below 100 90% time , max it has been 108. Also , post 2 hours of meal bt BG level are below 120 . 

However, there is bit improvement ED but not much and my testorene level are low (200 ng)
But that infections and numbeness are gone.

Low carb flours?,"I recently discovered Fiber Gourmet Low Carb Flour Blend, but its price is astronomical. For comparison, regular all-purpose flour costs an average of 52 cents per pound, whereas this low-carb variety is a whooping $7 per pound! However, the stuff is incredible. It tastes just like regular flour and cooks like it too. I already went through 2 lbs making pancakes, bread, and pasta with it. Astonishingly, the loaded mac and cheese I had last night after making noodles with my pasta maker registered barely a blip on my CGM. I’m hooked, but this doesn't feel sustainable, especially for the things I make with it.

Are there other brands similar to this that are kinder on the wallet?

Of course, I have a collection of standard low-carb flours like oat fiber, lupin, almond, coconut, etc. Still, I’ve had mixed success using those to produce food that comes out identical to the higher-carb variety, and it drives me bonkers that 98% of the recipes using these flours also try to be gluten-free. It’s just not the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14bdi78/low_carb_flours/,"['I’ve tried carb quik and it does not taste good.  I hope you get some good suggestions!', 'I buy one that is 6 bucks from the brand carrington farms at walmart. Its a chickpea flour. Sadly its seasoned but is great for ""fried foods"" or meatballs. The only other ones I would use for baking would be their sweet potato one. For pancakes/waffles I use the keto blend from birch benders.', ""I make my own.  I use vital wheat gluten, oat fiber, bamboo fiber, sometimes a bit of golden flaxseed or lupin flour for flavor, and sometimes some potato fiber for flavor.  When I can get away with it I scold the flour (mix with boiling water) to reduce the flavor and make it more standard white flour tasting.  You can add pure stevia powder to it if you need to sweeten it without burning it, so you can cook normal recipes.\n\nThe challenge with low carb flour is the starch.  Some foods do not need starch, eg if I'm baking home made real low carb white bread, eg yeast, gluten, knead, rise, and all that, it doesn't need any starch.  But if I'm making home made flatbread like roti canai, it needs some starch.  Likewise anything chewy the chew comes from starch, so eg chocolate chip cookies are hard to make a low carb version that tastes really good.  (edit: Also, this flour mixture consumes more water than normal flour, but other than that it works well.)\n\nI bought some green banana resistant starch to experiment with.  It is the only 100% resistant starch I can find on Amazon.  Eg, the flour you listed above has more than resistant starch in it.  Once I get some chocolate chips, I'm going to try adding some green banana resistant starch in with my low carb flour to see if I can get it nearly identical to high carb chocolate chip cookies.\n\nI do not recommend almond flour for most dishes.  The texture isn't great and it's really high in omega-6 so it's not the most healthy.  However, it does work great as an alternative to bread crumbs, or anything else that needs some texture.\n\nCoconut flour is interesting because each brand can taste quite a bit different.  I haven't found good coconut flour, but I can tell there is potential.\n\nI have other ingredients I've bought but have yet to try.  Pea protein powder, Macadamia nut flour.

Is it odd that my blood sugar is always highest after dinner no matter what I eat?,"Little background...I was diagnosed last September with an A1C of 10.9 and was put on 1,000 mg of Merformin.  Immediately made drastic diet changes, cutting out the bulk of the carbs I was eating and got down to 5.6 in three months. That's the good news. 

For the last few months, I've noticed that my blood sugar is highest 2 hours after I eat dinner no matter what I eat...for example, today for lunch I had a half a boneless chicken breast and a cup or so of cooked spinach. Blood sugar 2 hours later was 89. For dinner I had another half chicken breast, a cut up red bell pepper and 2tbsp of hummus. Blood sugar 2 hours later was 126. 

Last night I had a salad for dinner (iceburg lettuce, red bell pepper, chicken breast, cucumber, sharp cheddar, couple tbsp raw onion and yogurt based dressing) after dinner by blood sugar was 138. 

It just doesn't make sense to me...I can eat the exact same thing for lunch and dinner and my blood sugar is significantly higher after dinner. The only thing I can think is that I'm eating dinner too late..I usually don't get a chance to eat until around 7pm. 

Any thoughts on why this might be the case?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14beehb/is_it_odd_that_my_blood_sugar_is_always_highest/,"[""The gold standard for non diabetics is below 140 post prandial, and you're doing fine in that regard.

Basmati rice and my T2 saga,"Read a few days ago that basmati was lower on the glycemic index than my weakness - white rice. 

I struggle with the favorites now being terrible for control - potatoes, white rice. A little dark humor for you guys: When I jump off this mortal coil, hopefully decades from now, one of the first few things I will have when I get to the pearly gates will be McDonald’s french fries, a giant regular Coke and a huge cheesecake. And it will be glorious! I have been Type 2 for 5 years and I’m owed that much if I make it that far. 💁🏾‍♀️

Anyway, I tried basmati rice yesterday and charted my results. Testing before I ate was 87. Three hours after I ate and with no medication beforehand was 131. Eating, when I don’t dumb things, usually yield that result. So, I’d say this was a win for me yesterday. 

I’m not planning to do this often; I’ve cut down on rice in general since diagnosis. I went from 3 times a week to once every 3 or 4 months, if then. 

I just thought I’d pass along my success and a tip for someone who might be new in the game that is Type 2.

Can caffeine spike your blood sugar?,My readings have been all over the place recently.

8month checkup report,"First I want to thank everyone including y’all on this sub for the encouragement and for giving me every reason to stick strictly to the right foods and exercise programs I needed. 

So I went in for my 8 month checkup today, and was told that I am 100% clear to get back into weightlifting and all the other activities we normally have to be careful about. I was also told to go ahead and only test 3-4 times a week. 

No meds of any kind needed. 

BG 95 at time of testing today with my average being around 80-90. 

My A1C at diagnosis was 14.5, dropped steadily, and is projected to be well within normal range. Results in about 3 days. 

My doctor credited my progress to: 

Regular testing to see what I do and do not get spikes from

Keto diet (~40g-50g of net carbs per day max)

Weight loss of 47lbs (so far) 

A solid cardio regimen (P90X)

No “cheat” days/meals

Sticking to good sleep patterns

Anyway, I want to say that a “normal” life is possible. 

I am going to use the word “us” here because we are all in the same situation overall. 

I know for some of us in this sub, physical activity is limited. Some of us just can’t get BG under control because of body chemistry. You are not to blame for that. 

Some of us lose motivation for various reasons. Some just simply let cravings and wants take over our minds and we do what we shouldn’t. 

Regardless, I am posting today because I know there are some of us who can and will do what is required to get this shit under control. For those that can and will, keep going!

Not Diagnosed - Has my anxiety/panic been blood sugar all along?,"Hi all, I'm getting no where with the doctors so thought I ask the hive mind. I've been on PPI's for about 7-8 years for a hiatus hernia. I am overweight and work from home. But do walk 7500 steps per day.

Never had mental health issue, life is great etc. Queue ER trip, all things check, heart is good, bloods are good, sugar is good. Now I started doing intermittent fasting to lose some weight and noticed that when I'm fasting in the morning, I am rock solid, no anxiety (or small amount as I'm sure I developed anxiety over the years because of this). Once I've eaten however I have noticed that I'll start to feel anxiety/hypo around three hours afterwards and eat again and then feel fine till dinner and then good till bed. So I don't feel the anxiety/panic/hypo feeling as long I as I eat every three hours ONCE I start eating. If I'm fasting I'm fine. Bought a glucose monitor and found the below. Turns out my mother also gets these shaky episodes, but every time we go to the docs, they just check sugars and say they are fine.

Boyfriend with poorly controlled T2,"I’m coming here looking to vent, looking for advice, hoping to hear from people who have had similar experiences. I’ve been with my boyfriend for ~5 years, he’s a (50s) wonderful man and we’ve built a happy life together. But lately I’ve really been struggling with the way he manages (or doesn’t manage!) his diabetes. 

When we first started dating, he did not disclose his diagnosis for… at least a year? I eventually found an insulin pen when I was looking for something and he finally told me. I figured it was his right to be private about it, but in hindsight I think it’s part of a larger trend of denial. He’s on metformin, no longer on insulin, which he says his doctor discontinued.

I do think he tries to eat well, but his sugar addiction is so overpowering. I try to encourage him to make little changes (sugar free Gatorade, diet soda) and while he’s progressing very slightly, he still just eats so much carby, sweet food. He doesn’t reliably check his blood sugars, and his last A1c was 9.4 — this was at least 6 months ago, and his PCP referred him to endocrine, which he has not followed up on, instead saying he would make changes himself. He hasn’t really made changes that I can appreciate, and hasn’t had his A1c rechecked. 

He recently got into a bike accident and scraped his leg, then had to be admitted to the hospital with a wound infection. His doctor told him his sugars were very high, likely contributing to the situation. He is home now and struggling with pain and dressing changes. While he was in the hospital, he seemed appropriately alarmed about the situation, but now he’s dragging his feet making follow up appointments and today he came home with a bunch of sweet pumpkin breads from the store, which spurred an argument between us. 

I’m so afraid of what’s to come - wounds that won’t heal? Amputation? Dialysis? But I’m also SO FRUSTRATED with him, it’s overwhelming at times. I try to buy healthy food, support him in good decisions, advocate for options like CGM, remind him to follow up with endocrine/recheck A1c, etc, most of which I think he perceives as nagging. It doesn’t help that I work in healthcare, so I think he sees me as lecturing him or treating him like a patient. But it’s hard for me too because I take care of people everyday who have serious complications from diabetes, and I know just how bad it can be. I’ve tried to explain this to him and I feel like he just shuts down. I’m a person who likes to plan and organize, and I just want to set up a million appointments for him and build him a meal plan and monitor his sugars, but obviously none of these things are realistic or appropriate. I know it’s his body and life, but damn I just want to get through to him and get him doing better. 

Advice? Commiseration? I’ll take it. It’s 4 AM and I’ve been stewing about this and just feel like I need an outlet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/145vyjd/boyfriend_with_poorly_controlled_t2/,"["" He's not going to magically get better at managing it and from the post I can already see the resentment brewing both sides.

You cannot convince me that sugar isn’t the most addicting substance on the planet. I’m sure he wants to change but his body, hormones and brain chemicals have been hi jacked. The changes he need to make are similar to a heroin addict. What I mean by that is the discomfort mentally and physically that comes with the change till his body adjusts. He prob needs therapy too. There are certain times where I believe an ultimatum is justified. I threatened to leave my husband if he didn’t stop drinking (he was a functioning alcoholic ) and he did. Because that pain was worse then the pain of stopping drinking. The fear of the current situation has to get bad enough to over come the fear and discomfort of changing. The sneaky thing about your bf problem is that the food = dopamine and it feels good. So he’s not uncomfortable.

Your best options are to try to get a CGM for him, which will show what the foods he eats are doing to his blood sugar in real time.

They took one look at that, put me on a bunch of meds (insulin included), and sent me home to control my numbers before they would even talk about fixing me. The first couple of days were rough. Lots of crying, frustration, anger and disappointment in myself. How could I have let my health get so bad?! I am the one who always fixes all the problems for my family. All of a sudden I was the problem.\n\nThen it clicked. It didn\'t matter how or why. Blame didn\'t matter anymore. I had to fix my own problem.

Don\'t encourage the diet drinks. These may be sabotaging him. They can cause additional cravings for sweet things, and the artificial sweeteners can actually cause an increase in blood sugar. If he must have soda, try Zevia if it\'s available. He will need to try a variety of flavors because people seem to respond differently to stevia as a sweetener. I can\'t stand the cola, but I like the gingerale, root beer, and black cherry flavors. I can\'t drink the cream soda, either, but that goes back to an overconsumption incident as a child. The flavor profile is accurate.\n\n2. If you live together, do all the grocery shopping and only keep approved foods in the house. Also, do meal and snack planning. Don\'t tell him you\'re doing this. Just do it. Observe his behavior. Preemptively offer him an ""approved"" snack at the time he would typically get the munchies. This is horribly unfair to you on multiple levels, but it may be the only thing that works right now. He will still occasionally bring sweet things home, but if you reduce the need for him to do that, the overall impact will be less.\n\n3. If you have to feed his sweet craving, look for keto dessert recipes that leverage natural non-nutritive or low-carb sweeteners (monk fruit, stevia, erythritol). It would be great if you could get him on a Keto diet (sweet cravings would greatly diminish), but you can\'t do this without his buy-in because he will feel like crap for a couple weeks.\n\nGetting him to go to the endocrinologist should be top priority.', 'A person has to take responsibility for their life.  \n\nThere are serious consequences with unmanaged diabetes.', 'OP.

Do numbers tell the whole story?,"I ask this knowing that diabetes is lifelong once you have it, but my question is ""are blood tests misleading if one's diabetes is in remission""?

I've probably simplified this to the point that my reasoning is off, but I mean, if numbers are what's the diagnosis of diabetes is based upon, then what if they don't tell the whole story?

Consider these 2 scenarios: 

1) Person 1 has diabetes based on their first test, does lifestyle changes for 3+ months without medication, and on their second test is within non-diabetic range. This person still has diabetes and knows it.

2) Person 2 has diabetes but doesn't know it, does lifestyle changes for 3+ months without medication, and on their first test is now within non-diabetic range. This person still has diabetes but still doesn't know it.

How would Person 2 know their condition of diabetes?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/145wawc/do_numbers_tell_the_whole_story/,"['I think of it as a spectrum and being diagnosed as finding the hard limit of what your body can handle. Lifestyle and diet can move people in and out of the various categories and we’ll never really know who is actually diabetic at any moment. Probably not that different from other diseases where there is a chance for remission and plenty of people have a benign form that they never look into.\n\nI would argue that person 2 would be unlikely to make the changes that genuinely move the beetus needle. Unless they went low carb and kept on it, started fasting etc, the old lifestyle would creep back in. They would count calories and commit to jogging 10 miles a day until they got bored of it. My guess is that the beetus would win eventually if they don’t understand how to actually fight it. With 50% of the US population in some form of pre or full diabetes, it’s obvious how we are approaching the disease is wrong.\n\nFrom what I’ve read after getting diagnosed, t2d is driven by a high-carb lifestyle and it’s hard as hell to eat “normal food” in America and not get nutpunched by carbs every meal if you don’t understand what low carb actually looks like. Genetics play a part, but diet has an overwhelming influence on the course of the disease.', 'Another paradigm to consider:\n\nMost of Type 2 diabetics are the carb intolerant flavor.\n\nThere\'s absolutely a genetic component for how many carbs one can continuously consume before insulin resistance starts and begins to spiral.\n\nThink of Lactose Intolerant. There\'s nothing ""Wrong"" with lactose intolerant people. There are far more Lactose Intolerant adults than not. Such folks learn not to drink milk, but many are able to use heavy cream, eat hard cheese, and yogurt - products with little lactose. So they manage by avoiding the cause of the problem.\n\nIf you eat fewer carbs than your genetic tolerance quantity, your insulin resistance will eventually heal. Lots of folks have weaned themselves off medications over time.\n\nYou may be able to Occasionally Binge carbs, but keep doing it and the insulin resistance will return.\n\nInsulin resistance gets started when you constantly eat more carbs than your genetic tolerance.\n\nIt\'s been a pet peeve of mine that Type 2 would be so much easier to diagnose at the earliest stages if a cheap insulin level test would have been developed, instead of cheap blood glucose testing.\n\nMost folk\'s pancreas are able to Dump enough insulin to keep blood glucose levels in range for quite awhile - even overcoming insulin resistance - until it can\'t.

I might be wrong. I might be right. 🤷\u200d♀️\n\n🔶️ If I\'m understanding things correctly, the metabolic processes for producing energy are a bit like the biological version of a factory, using various inputs and pieces of equipment to transform the inputs into desired outputs + waste products. \n\n🔹️Inputs include carbs, fats, proteins + micronutrients\n\n🔹️Equipment includes mitochondria\n\n🔹️Desired output is energy\n\n\n🔶️The process for making energy can break down at any step:\n\n🔹️Insufficient inputs could be a result of starvation or malabsorption, but could also be as simple as a vitamin deficiency (most of the necessary parts are available, but one critical piece is missing)\n\n🔹️Equipment failure can occur when there are mitochondrial defects (look up mitochondrial disease or mitochondrial dysfunction)\n\n\n❓ If the body lacks sufficient energy, what does it do? Does it ""order more inputs"" by signaling hunger? Does it do so even when inputs are sufficient and defective equipment is responsible for the problem?\n\n⚪ High blood sugar indicates more carb inputs than the body can metabolize. It says nothing about why the body is unable to metabolize the carbs.\n\n⚪ Normal blood sugar indicates carb intake is at or below the threshold that the body can handle. It says nothing about how much energy is being produced and made available to the body.\n\n❓ If energy production is insufficient but blood sugar is normal, what are the symptoms? \n\nNote: One of the waste products from the use of protein as fuel is uric acid. Uric acid crystals concentrating in the joints cause gout symptoms. Gout is a common occurrance in Type 2 Diabetics. My theory is that Type 2 Diabetics are more often in a metabolic state of being unable to use either carbs or fat for energy production, so the body resorts to using protein. \n\n>Person 2...on their first test is now within non-diabetic range. This person still has diabetes but still doesn\'t know it.\n\n>How would Person 2 know their condition of diabetes?\n\nThey wouldn\'t know. But they might still have symptoms. Someone with well-controlled Type 2 Diabetes may still experience slower healing, slower resolution of illness, and increased susceptibility to illness. And, if my theory is correct, increased risk of developing gout. \n\nBlood tests are an easy way to find non-controlled diabetes. They don\'t do anything to identify those whose blood sugar is controlled either by lifestyle *or* by a pancreas that\'s working nonstop to pump out insulin to try to cope. Unfortunately, the blood tests are the only diagnostic criteria we have available currently, so it\'s only by overloading the system completely that diagnosis of diabetes becomes possible.', ""unless you have really hard symptoms it's hard to know you are diabetic.\n\nIt's an insidious and progressive condition.\n\nScenario 2, probably this person is non-diabetic or just on the border of being diabetic."", 'The only way you know is by taking a blood glucose test after eating.

Doesnt that just mean the person who had t2 numbers just had severe insulin resistance and changed their lifestyle so they no longer had it?

Finally Some Progress!,"I'm 22 (M) and I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes at 17.

Fasting trains you body to absorb the sugar better from your blood. PS: don’t this without talking to your doctor for those of you that are already on insulin due to hypoglycemia concerns. \n\n2) strength exercise: Add some strength training to the walking. More muscles means higher rate of sugar absorption from the blood.\n\n3) Mix protein and fats into your diet. For example, eating greek yogurt with your strawberries is a lot better than just the same quantity of strawberries. Proteins and fats actually delay absorption of sugar into your blood. Also fats are really great for people with diabetes or looking to lose weight as the insulin response is minimal.\n\n 4) Contiune to lose weight: Lower body fat is associated with better ability to respond to insulin.\n\nFinally, make sure you are getting all the other checks done when you have diabetes such as the eye tests.

Question about Ozempic & insulin/pancreas & beta cells.,"So, I have been insulin resistant for a long long long time. In recent years, officially became Type 2 diabetic.

Back last August, I began...and stuck to...a dose of 2x500mg Metformin ER per day. My A1C has dropped from 8.6 to **5.7**. So Yay!

That said, I have not done as well as I could with diet and exercise and in recent months I did stop checking my meter. So this is all bad and something I obviously need to get back on top of. I have lost about 23 lbs overall, but need to lose another 80 to 100.

This last week when we did my most recent bloodwork, we actually did a total insulin (I was fasting) which we don't normally do.  It was high. The reference number on the results said under 18.4 was optimal. Mine was 38!!!

My doctor is not pressing Ozempic or Mounjaro too hard, but they are on the table. 

**Now for the question part!**

On a few things I've googled about Ozempic, it says it stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin! Given my already high insulin, that doesn't seem like a great idea. I'm sure my pancreas has been producing excessive insulin for a long time. And I've seen references to beta cell burnout? Where the pancreas just can't produce any more?

So, does Ozempic really stimulate additional insulin production? Is there a similar medication that does not do that? Does Mounjaro do the same?

In the long run, it seems like weight loss/diet/exercise is the only thing that will improve (lessen) the insulin production/insulin resistance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/145hu1m/question_about_ozempic_insulinpancreas_beta_cells/,"['GLP1 agonists do push for more insulin at meal time. Mounjaro is a dual GLP1 and GIP agonist, so yes. \n\nRestricting carbs and losing weight are primary methods for reducing insulin.', ""Your doctor is smart to look at your fasting insulin level.  It's pretty rare to find one competent enough in diabetes treatment (VS the majority who only know the standard of care nonsense) to do so.  Based on that alone, I suspect you're in very good hands.  My doctor was puzzled when I requested that particular lab.\n\n>In the long run, it seems like weight loss/diet/exercise is the only thing that will improve (lessen) the insulin production/insulin resistance?\n\nYes, there are short-term cheats, but determining what a proper diet is and following it is the only long-term solution.  Exercise can be helpful too, but don't make the mistake of going half-in on diet, and trying to make up for that with exercise.  Diet is what really matters for results.\n\n>So, does Ozempic really stimulate additional insulin production? Is there a similar medication that does not do that? Does Monjauro do the same?\n\nDoesn't matter.  Unless you're really doing it wrong, you'll lose so much weight and so quickly on a GLP1 that your insulin levels should already be dropping in weeks.  Only real downside is that for most people GLP1 drugs aren't really like antibiotics (where you take them when you're sick and stop after you're better).  They're more like a lifelong subscription you have to keep renewing every month to maintain your progress.  Doesn't have to be this way, but for many they keep eating the same things and rely on the drugs doing their magic."", 'So the Ozempic stimulation of insulin production is not constant? It is based on digestion factors?\n\nThanks. Definitely something I will ask my doc about next time.', ""Thanks! Unfortunately, she hasn't regularly tested the insulin level, but did this time. Of course, I've only been seeing her since 2021 and I don't remember when or if a previous doctor tested or not.\n\nI have been resistant towards it because of the lifelong aspect of it. I do have insurance now, but it is through the marketplace and who knows what will happen in the long run, etc. Or if we can continue to afford the monthly premiums.

Breakfast = eggs & ham with salsa, Lunch & Dinner = large salad (lettuce, cucumber, celery, radish, green pepper, black olives, egg & Olive Garden Italian dressing), homemade chicken salad, cottage cheese, gumbo (for some reason the rice doesn't seem to affect me) and finally strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and an occasional apple.  I don't snack much, but if I do it's been pistachios.  Obviously, I have the occasional surprise meal, but I do a reasonably good job of steering clear of carbs, etc.  I have started to drink scotch again recently.  I hadn't drank for a few months until a week or so ago.

My blood sugar was 500+ 5 weeks ago.

I've been on Metformin ER 1000mg for years and am now on Lispro, Tresiba and Ozempic.  The Lispro is 3X a day on a scale of 0-10 and lately I usually just need 2 units.  The Tresiba is 25 units every night.  And the Ozempic is 25 units once a week (one more @ 25 and then I go to 50).

My blood sugar first thing in the morning ranges between 110 and 125 (156 on one occasion).  Before lunch is in the mid to high 120's (93 on one occasion).  Before dinner is 110 to 130 (94 on one occasion).

I've begun to question why I'm eating any fruit at all?  I've eaten somewhat carefully for a long time (30 years) and done Atkins, Keto (lazy), etc. so it's somewhat natural for me to go this direction - I've done it before.  The fruit seems to be green lighted from what I read, but now I'm wondering if I should leave that out?  We always have a supply of berries around, so I eat them in moderation, but regularly.  I make a point to eat the berries before they go bad on me.

I don't see my doc until August.  I can see progress, but from what I read, my numbers are still a little high (considering the drugs I'm taking?).  My doc did tell me up front that it would be a gradual process, but I seem to be stalled in the 110 - 120 range.

My diet is pretty simple and I've weeded out things that seemed to have set me off (oatmeal & granola).

Anyone see any changes I should make?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1456zqp/my_diet_and_my_readings/,"['Honestly I would cut out the rice and limit the fruit for now, even if only to get off some of the meds.

So talking to your doctor about that seems like the way to go, if you do decide you want to take that path.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT),"Hi, just wondering what people's levels for these things are? On my blood test, it says that the ALA should be less than 50 and the ALT should be less than 36.

I suppose a related question would be wondering if anyone here has non-alcoholic fatty liver, or cirrhosis, (or other liver problems) and if that was related to their diabetes?

I don't know how to feel,"So the other day I posted my diagnosis and a brainstormed diet plan in which I got fantastic and caring feedback. Thank you all! 

Only drastic change so far: reduced rice intake (eating 1-3 teaspoons). Reduced beans intake (1 teaspoon).

Not really drastic change: home workout 3 times a week. Walk about an hour on the beach once a week. Zero fast food. 500ml of water during lunch 500ml of water during dinner.

Got a glucose monitoring device and started testing. Day 1 lunch results 111. Dinner results 125 (raised an eyebrow). Had a cooked egg and cheese as a late night snack.

Day 2 fasting (8 hours) 88. Lunch 113. Dinner wasn't too different. No medicine was taken.

So I'm new to this and I  swear I'm doing my best not to sound dramatic, hypochondriac or cocky but if had gotten these results before I would have never even gone to a lab to get tested. I'm just trying to understand if rice alone can be that bad.

Not asking for medical advice, just opinions. I WILL see a doc. I'm trying to schedule but I live in a small city.

I have NAFLD in the future,  probably as a result of switching to a really fatty diet after my T2 diagnoses.    Don\'t snack on those pepperoni sticks.

You can make this work by:  Making a veggie container and put it in the fridge - one with a lid that seals.   Celery, Carrots, Broccoli, Tomatoes, Cauliflower etc.       Before each meal, fill up with a good amount of these before each meal.   They are effectively free.   Large glass of water.     Snack on these while making your meal.  Then eat your meal.    You will have filled up on low carb, low fat food before your start your meal.   I will feel full and satiated as a result and have ate less of the food that will spike your blood sugar.   If I want to snack - head to the fridge and get out the veggie container.   \n\nOn my plate:  no more than 1/4 of the area should be carbs.   Prefer chicken, pork and fish over beef.   Don\'t cut out red meat completely though.    Avoid lunch meats.     Eat more whole grain foods and fiber rich fruits such as apples, berries and bananas.      No more breakfast cereals they are almost all terrible for me.    \n\nIn my cup:     I love coffee, expresso and cappuccino and even latte with 1%.   DO not consume pops, slurpy, diet pops etc.           Avoid diet pop it tastes like ass and water is better anyways.     Fresh lemon water, especially in the morning.   Cut a lemon in half, juice it.  2 tbsp of it in a very large glass of water.     Actually tastes pretty good when you get used to it.      \n\nSelf, avoid eating too much of the ""keto"" snack foods that have sugar alcohols.   \n\nCut out:  Simple carbs such as sugar drinks.    But do eat complex carbs.\n\nEvery day - something exercise wise.   Walk the dog, 45 mins.  Rainy day, get on the exercise bike.     Nice day  ride the bicycle.

"Supplements (apple cider vinegar, berberine, cinnamon)--anyone tried these w/meds?","I was diagnosed almost a year ago, and for about the first 3-4 months my meds (1000 mg metformin 2x daily for 2k daily total, and 10 mg Jardiance once daily) were working perfectly.
