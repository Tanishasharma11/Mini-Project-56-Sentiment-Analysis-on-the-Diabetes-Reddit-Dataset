Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Diabetes wise: my numbers are definitely harder to manage, but I’ve been doing a good job controlling it as much as possible. I have been doubling my boluses to try to keep my numbers from being high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/g7ewx5/coronavirus_and_t1d/,I pinned this to the top of the page so that we'll all remember to check-in with your daily updates.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs.

I'm a 40+ year type 1 in good control, but not perfect.  A1C was 5.5 last time, but I still spike far too much than I'd like.  I figure that's due to metal instability, which is obviously worse with this situation.  And, yes, spike over 300 enough to bother me.  But, hearing that someone who is also in good control could handle this issue is a feel good situation.  I'm not banking that if I get Covid 19 that I will have similar results, but that similar is possible in at least a random outcome if nothing.  Thanks and good health to you in the future."

I had pizza for dinner last night and went high overnight, but usually my blood sugar stays over 160 or 170, I woke up with it at 120, It had peaked at 250 through the night though, with a sharp crash to baseline afterwards. I took no insulin for that.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between.

At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms.

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

I've read about recent studies showing that low Vitamin D levels are associated with easier transmission, that the Tuberculosis vaccine has a positive effect on the severity of the illness, and that countries with MMR vaccines that extend to later years show a lower infection rate - which may explain why children are less affected by the virus (more recent MMR). 

Would you mind providing some details on your meds and vaccines? Do you take D supplements? Anything else? Have you had either of those vaccines? Do you know how recent?

Thanks"

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

There is really no way to know how you will do. If you have any sort of micro or macro vascular issues, complications or are overweight if have terrible control (or other comorbidities or autoimmune issues) I’d say it’s doomsday but then again I have other (non D, non lifestyle) risk factors and was fine. 

Most young otherwise healthy T1s I wouldn’t lose too much sleep. Like anything there will always be someone who dies from the flu, a cold, a common infection etc underlying issues or not. Not much you can do, just live your life.

Personally I’d rather die rapidly from a viral infection than slowly from chronic disease. But that’s just me. Got to die from something. If D complications really any better? Never understood the panic TBH.

Don’t mask unless I must and only a cloth mask not a medical grade OHS fitted N95 switched out once an hour. So my mask does zero."

I have been doubling my boluses to try to keep my numbers from being high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/g7ewx5/coronavirus_and_t1d/,"I don't know if my story will help but I'll share it.

I've been a diabetic for almost 15 years (I am now 29). I have had a spotted history of lung infections and in rare cases, pneumonia. I caught Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic. I was sick for about a week and it passed without too much issue. My blood sugars during my battle with Covid-19 were unaffected, maybe even better than usual because I ate less.  I was sick, but still able to go about most daily activities without any problems. In the past, I have had flus and other infections send me to the hospital or at the very least have to use an inhaler for a short period of time while sick. I was lucky that Covid-19 wasn't effective at all against me. Testing didn't really exist at this time (it was early 2020), but I took multiple antibody tests later on that came back positive for Covid-19 infection. So, either this sickness was Covid-19 or I was completely asymptomatic when I was infected. That is HIGHLY unlikely based on how I react to most respiratory infections.

About 7 months back, I was forced to get the Covid-19 vaccine by my ex employers under threat of termination. I opted for the J&J shot, because I figured it was just one dose and I'd be rid of it. That ""vaccine"" lead to me being bed ridden for 3 weeks and having to visit the ER twice with severe breathing problems. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had with being sick. My blood sugars were wild, I wasn't eating, and my usually mild gastroparesis went absolutely nuts during this time and for about two months after recovery.  The gastroparesis also lead to me being unable to work for said ex employer which lead to them ""letting me go"". So, I was fired regardless.

Up until very recently, I have been having heart problems as well as increased anxiety. My vision at a distance has also noticeably decreased within the last 6 months. My doctors at Kaiser Permanente kept saying its just complications with diabetes. Strange that I wouldn't have any issues at all, ever, until this incident...right after this shot...but I digress.

I am now no longer with Kaiser Permanente as on January 1st and have joined a private practice. My gastro health has improved dramatically, I am working for a new company that allows working from home some days, and I have solid natural immunity despite the shot that almost killed me. I am on multiple natural supplements that have been scientifically proven to work against general infection and Covid-19 specifically. So far, I am having zero new issues and the issues that came from the shot have lessened dramatically. I am still having vision issues, but my heart problems have stopped and my anxiety is basically gone.

Again, don't know if this helps anyone, but I wanted to share my experience with Covid-19 being a diabetic. Maybe it'll stir up some conversation."

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Keep in mind your immune system is actually pretty solid if you are a type 1. Too much misinformation going around that T1 diabetics are fragile just because we have T1 diabetes. That is how you likely got T1 diabetes to begin with, by having a supercharged immune system. It attacked your pancreas and killed the beta cells. If you are a T2 diabetic then you have to seriously be careful."

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

It’s entirely possible your body fought back harder than average and you’ve got some residual action.

I used to routinely get situations like this, periods of not needing any insulin for massive amounts of carbs, constant unexplained lows etc. I am T1 since age 1-2, negative for MODY, etc etc."
Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Diabetes wise: my numbers are definitely harder to manage, but I’ve been doing a good job controlling it as much as possible.

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

I have my partner and my dogs and cat and I still try to get outside and do things in spread out areas or backyards of family members following extreme social distancing measures, but the only place I’ve been inside of other than my house was the dentist for an emergency procedure. I’m trying to read more, spend more times on crafting and other creative projects/hobbies, and I’ve been spending more time on Reddit trying to “socialize” that way. Which is probably why this is turning into a novel lol. 

Anyway, curious as to when you (or anyone else in a similar situation!) are planning on trying to go out again? Are you waiting for a vaccine? Or if numbers start really going down would you be comfortable trying to go to the store or something like that? It is way too earlier to think about it yet, but I’m not sure what is actually safe for us."

I wouldn’t be scared to go eat outdoors and live your life. Just keep your distance from sick people and wear an N95 indoors. I only got it because I went to a few indoor bars last weekend. I think eating outdoors at a restaurant is actually pretty therapeutic and makes you feel like a human again. It’s relatively safe and you could always ask your server to wear a mask because you’re immunocompromised. I’m sure they’d understand and you could tell them you’ll give them a bigger tip.

Coronavirus and T1D,"Edit 12/25 As of yesterday, I’m on my 3rd COVID diagnosis. I think I’ve just gotten unlucky (despite being vaccinated) and I’ve gotten all 3 variants lol

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

Day 4: I just had a slight cough and a headache, but it wasn’t that bad. I started taking azithromycin to treat the respiratory symptoms. 

Day 5: I got my results and it was positive. I was told to complete the antibiotics, take Tylenol for the headache, take a prescription they gave me for the cough, and to continue taking multivitamins. 
At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

At this point, I was able to feel my lungs if I took a deep breath. I compare it to the feeling you get when you run for a really long time. It’s like a slight pressure/cramp in your lungs. 
My old endocrinologist prescribed an inhaler (albuterol sulfate) just in case I end up needing it. 

Day 6: I had no bad symptoms. It’s mainly the symptom of feeling my lungs, coughing, and getting shortness of breath during talking a lot or walking around. I also lost my sense of smell and tastE for the most part.

Day 7: I have a cough, and pressure in my chest/lungs. I don’t know how I’d really describe it.

Day 8: I just have a cough and a little bit of pressure in my chest.

Day 9: I had a cough and my throat started feeling sore. My tonsils seem inflamed. My nose also has a burning sensation. It’s kind of weird to describe. 

Day 10: I have a cough. Same burning nose sensation. Shortness of breath. I lightly worked out with A LOT of breaks in between. 

Day 11: I have a cough and shortness of breath with tasks like going up stairs.

Day 12: I CAN SMELL AND TASTE AGAIN! I also talked to my nurse and she said because I haven’t had a fever in the last three days, my last positive test result was over a week ago, and my symptoms have improved, I no longer need to isolate from people in my house 🥳

Day 13: I feel great other than a cough. Slight shortness of breath.

Day 14: just a cough 🤩

Diabetes wise: my numbers are definitely harder to manage, but I’ve been doing a good job controlling it as much as possible. I have been doubling my boluses to try to keep my numbers from being high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/g7ewx5/coronavirus_and_t1d/,The dexcom is a game changer! I’d also try to get a pump if that’s something you guys are interested in and if insurance covers it. It definitely helps with control and it’s less exhausting to deal with diabetes and life.

Hey y’all! I’m a type one, diagnosed 4ish years ago. I tested positive for coronavirus. I’m currently doing fine. But I wanted to post this, in case someone has concerns about coronavirus and it’s relation to diabetes. :) I want to be a resource for whoever needs it!

Edit:
How I got it: my dad had been sick during Easter weekend. But doctors told him he had a sinus infection. They went ahead and put an order in for him to get tested. I went back to my apartment near school. A few days later, the result cake back positive. So I knew I had been exposed. My mom also got sick. (They are currently recovering with no complications).

It would also probably be helpful to outline my symptoms and the whole timeline. So I will be updating this daily with any new symptoms.

I am currently on day 14 of symptoms.

Day 1: I had a weird mucousy cough. I have allergies so coughing is normal for me. But this felt different and it was a little more frequent. 

Day 2: I had a really bad headache along with the cough.

Day 3: I had a sore throat, the headache, and the cough. I also had joint pain. My doctor decided I should get tested because I had been directly exposed and I have diabetes. I went ahead and got tested that day. I took Tylenol to treat the headache and it worked fine.

I am terrified of insulin pumps,"I had one when I was first diagnosed about 16 years ago and I remember nothing but awful things about it. I remembered catching the tube on something and ripping the site out or the site just hurting. I would rollover in my sleep and be woken up by a terrible stabbing pain or feeling pain in the site when I moved a certain way. They would also cause rashes and become infected. 

Have they gotten better? I want to get one but it terrifies me that I will be dealing with the same issues. The pain and irritation is not something I want to deal with again. I recently got a CGM and have not had issues with the adhesive on it, but have had issues with the adhesive on different covered. I finally found some that work but the pump still freaks me out. 

Has anyone had any issues like this that have gotten better as technology has improved? The whole thing freaks me out but I also want to manage my diabetes better!


Edit: sorry for the format I am in mobile and it is truly awful looking when posted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14pwoxk/i_am_terrified_of_insulin_pumps/,"Pumps have come a long, long way since then. The Omnipod 5 has a starter kit that might be covered for you, if you’re in the US. It comes with about a month of pump supplies, and you’re not locked into anything if you hate it. 

That particular pump takes some getting used to because it “learns” your body, but I thought it was of after 4 or so pods. 

You may also want to talk to your care team to see if they may have a demo you can try (with saline…not insulin), but I’m not sure. It’s worth a discussion, at least, to find out your options."

I would rollover in my sleep and be woken up by a terrible stabbing pain or feeling pain in the site when I moved a certain way. They would also cause rashes and become infected. 

Have they gotten better? I want to get one but it terrifies me that I will be dealing with the same issues. The pain and irritation is not something I want to deal with again. I recently got a CGM and have not had issues with the adhesive on it, but have had issues with the adhesive on different covered. I finally found some that work but the pump still freaks me out. 

Has anyone had any issues like this that have gotten better as technology has improved? The whole thing freaks me out but I also want to manage my diabetes better!

You change it every 10 days and will sound alarms for highs and lows while telling you how fast it is rising or falling to prevent those super dangerous lows, life threatening lows. And, an insulin pump regulates your diabetes much better than the old fashioned syringe. More freedom with food and automatically tells you how much insulin to cover meals and correct bs's. I've had one since 2000 and it's been a game changer. I'm here to help"
BS was 24 when I woke up today,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14plh4w/bs_was_24_when_i_woke_up_today/,"I smoked a ton of weed in high school, got type 1 junior year and it's not genetic. Nooobody in my family got any type of diabetes ever so these doctors hear that and got a wtf expression everytime ahahaha it's evil but it makes me smile and those turds are evil too.

I had a schedule for my endless shots of whiskey and juice for years, worked out pretty well for me. I just love alcohol more than weed, I'm in nyc and all I smoke is a nicotine vape now, once in a while I feel like a strong person hah. Lucky I got epilepsy, I think it erased 95% chance of feelings (not connected to my diabetes, it also came from nowhere so don't worry about that)

Despite what people will tell you about depression and whatnot, I am usually pretty balanced and used to just get hit by a wave of intense negativity sometimes. I don't think there's a final cure but don't start taking supplements and pills and shit, it's heroin. Any kind of supposed cure won't help you find that within yourself and help you have a plan for next time, one you dont need help for and are more familiar with, one that will leave you less vulnerable to it. It's helps me to kind of let my mind wander, feel completely hopeless, empty and sort of confront myself hard, let it become almost extreme until it basically fills up and then pours out, so that you're back to a standard again. If you don't have a serious mental illness, you probably can't go wrong with it and if it turns out you do, you can identify exactly what it is and get better help, understanding this way. Laying flat on the floor in a dark room with no windows at all helps me a lot, to go back in it whenever the outside world triggers you and reflect on that, just keep going through the same trial and error until you have gotten past it on your own, sort of trained yourself. Laying flat and spread out helps a lot mentally because tons of physical issues that can trigger that.

Drink what you want, but I'm pretty sure more people drink beer and a lot more of it. It leaves you dehydrated which is never good for anything in health. Who wants to drink water all day before drinking beer later? I go all or nothing w pretty much everything, and think beer probably just turns out to destroy you slower, more long term.

At least that helps me a lot, hard in the beginning but it becomes a regular step just like insulin and whatnot.

I think tbh this is where a lot of confusion occurs; people think sugar but forget carbs are also a form of sugar; it’s the speed they’re digested at that makes the difference.

I also don't think most people have any knowledge of macronutrients much less how it impacts diabetics. The focus on sugar is largely borne from their shopping habits. Diabetic items are catered to type 2s and it's pretty much all just sugar free stuff.

(Assuming that’s a metric shown on your device)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14pw9nz/whats_your_typical_time_in_range_using_a_pump/,Ah so no override function at all. That concerns me as my insulin needs change drastically seasonally. I wonder if the 5 would be able to adapt…

Where I  work offers a few different plans, but I went with the PPO (it has the highest price per month premium), but it covers the most and I have very little out of pocket costs. 
When you have a chronic condition like T1D, you will usually benefit from the most inclusive plans.  Otherwise you may have large out of pocket costs which isn’t great with expensive meds like insulin."

If I'm in the direct sunlight and the pump is exposed e.g., beach volleyball, I drape a wet washcloth over the pump (crude evaporative cooling).

Aside from the above, watching your sensor reading trend should alert you to insulin being denatured and losing potency. You might also consider limiting the volume of insulin in your pump cartridge in order to discard a smaller volume if it's denatured. btw, I only denatured pump insulin once and it was due to body heat during a winter hike. Now if I'm hiking or cross-country skiing, I keep the pump in an outside pocket with a pass-through for the tubing to the infusion.

I’ve had a pump for plenty of summers, and it gets hecka hot here. If I’m near an indoor area, I may disconnect if it’s less than an hour or two - won’t affect your blood sugar very much. If it’s all day, I just make sure it stays under my shirt and out of the sun, hoping for the best. There are very few times I’ve managed to actually mess up the insulin, and almost all of them happened either sitting outside in direct sunlight or being disconnected and shoved in a black soccer bag. Insulin isn’t as fragile as some people act like it is. 

If you’re actually noticing that the insulin isn’t working as well, noticeably higher for several blood sugar checks, having to take multiple correction doses, etc - then it might be time to get a wrappable ice pack to wrap the pump, and stay in the shade. You could also switch to MDI if you’re really worried about it. I hope fourth of July goes well!"

I can’t say I’ve ever encountered a time where my pump overheated, but I’m also not in the direct sun (also have a tslim and can keep it out of direct sun while on me) I have a little cooler case with ice packs for my pens, but I’m sure that would work to cool off a pump for a few minutes. If you don’t have that, an insulated lunchbox with some ice packs might work too. 

I can say for sure though, please keep hydrated. Keep drinking water throughout the time you’re outside, even if you don’t feel thirsty. 

Everyone is different, but the heat causes a lot of hypos for me and increases my insulin sensitivity like crazy. Make sure you have plenty of hypo treats, not only fast acting sugars but carbs too. I often have to pair juice with a pack of crackers when I’m outside working. 

Bring something to use as a fan. Whether that’s a little battery powered one or piece of cardboard lol huge difference between stagnant and moving air

If you can bring a cooler or something, even better. You can keep snacks/juice and a frozen bandana or hat. Keep extra waters, more than you think you’ll need. You might want to pour water on you. Keep your sunscreen in there too, reapply it to keep you cool.

Hope this helps a little with some ideas :)"
Checking sugars,"So admittedly I am not the best diabetic. 5 years ago my a1c was at a 14. I have since lowered it to a 7 and got a dexcom cgm.

That would let you know as soon as you hit your set threshold.  You can start by not setting your high alarm too high.  The standard is 180 but many people set it higher because they find alarms annoying.  If you set it for the standard 70 low and 180 high you will probably still go low & high but you can fix them before they become a real problem.

Check your blood before the consequences. 

When I started checking I started putting everything in a spreadsheet. Don't download it. Write it somewhere. Force yourself to reflect on how often you checked and what the numbers were. Once you make a habit of that future you (writing down the numbers) will hold current you accountable.

I can’t wear a CGM as my daughter will rip it off the moment she finds it (happened before) so I don’t monitor my BSL as much as I should. 

It’s not all black and white with diabetes management.  Some people have a lot more time on their hands to manage it better while others do not. I do try my best but I don’t always achieve my best. Not comprehending others who don’t achieve the same results as you do is silly in itself. You don’t know what their lifestyle is like, their family life, their climate, their location etc. all this can affect the ability to manage diabetes effectively.  

I guess what I’m getting at is please do not assume diabetes is a simple condition to manage. Not everyone is like you and you don’t represent the diabetes community alone."

Day to day our vision can get blurry with BG fluctuation, sure. But if you have undiagnosed advanced retinopathy, a blood vessel can burst quite suddenly. For me, I was at work one day, lifted a heavy box, and then it looked like I had been staring at a bright light and had a weird flashing after image of some shape. Over the course of an hour it got bigger, and bigger. Turns out it was blood. Took me 8 months and two laser surgeries for it to mostly absorb, and lots of visits to the eye doc. I still go in every 10 weeks for a preventative injection.

If you are a diabetic and you see something odd in your vision that is more than just being a little blurry, go get it checked out! ASAP.

Also, if you get retinopathy in the USA, check and see if your state has a medicaid buy in program for working adults with disabilities. I wish I had known that up front, it would have saved me $20k in debt."

Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older. 

She will soon be a preteen and want to go do things with her friends that doesn’t involve us and I would hate for her to miss out on those kinds of things because she can’t take of herself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14o10gz/am_i_in_the_wrong_parent_of_t1d/,"I can’t speak as a parent, but as the child diagnosed at 7yo, you’re absolutely doing the right thing. I don’t remember when or how we transitioned from my parents doing everything to me doing it, but I can say that it was so important that it happened as early as possible. By doing what you’re doing, you’re giving her independence, control over her own condition and life, and confidence. She knows that she’s trusted to handle things herself. And the earlier she learns everything, the more able she’ll be to take care of herself when she has to without the safety net later.

Day 1. My parents were obviously there to support me and guide me, but they wanted me to know my disease was mine to manage and that I needed the confidence to manage it someday without them. That’s one of the best things my parents did for me. I’d sit your husband down and remind him that you guys don’t want your daughter to have diabetes be the thing that defines who she is. It’s definitely part of her,  but she needs to be able to make her own choices for her body. If she wants to go to college in 7 years, is he going to rent an apartment near by scared that she’s not going to make the right choices? At some point, she will resent the helicopter moments and honestly might rebel because of it.

You won’t be there when she goes to college or starts her first job. She will need to do all of this on her own. 

The best way to parent her is exactly what you’re doing - letting her take over her care, when she’s ready, and in gradual steps. An expired pod isn’t negligent by any means, since there’s a built in grace period and it’s not out of insulin. That’s WHY Insulet put the grace period in the software in the first place. If you’re in the US, then conserving supplies and insulin isn’t a new or novel thing with diabetics. 

Your partner needs a good therapist because that behavior isn’t normal."

Maybe with the Diabetes Educator or social worker present instead of the endo. 

Letting the leash go out is a difficult thing and your husband isn't ready for it (albeit you have more input due to proximity with her diabetes). While I agree it's a family decision, maybe come up with a checklist of things your daughter is able to demonstrate to your husband to make him feel more reassured. 

Obviously you need to be safe as insulin can harm when dosed incorrectly, but y'all need to discuss it together."
Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life.

I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child.

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

He should relax. It is amazing what 11 year olds can do when allowed. I was a T1 at 11 - No CGM or pump, 40+ years ago -It was kind of wing it approach and I survived and thrived. With a CGM and Pump it would have been so easy! How does she go to a friends house or a sleep over if she doesn’t manage herself? You are the judge of her abilities - some 11 year olds I wouldn’t trust with anything, but most can handle quite a lot. Maybe your partner was one of the untrustworthy 11 year olds and he is projecting.

You didn’t mention she is going high or low all the time, so I am going to assume she is doing a good job. Wearing a pod while it is still functioning and has plenty of insulin - EVERY diabetic does this. The pod as a 3 day +8 hours for precisely this use - it has been safely tested for this. As long as she is not abusing the +8 hours (like it expires in the middle of school and she has to come home), then why would anyone care? Have your partner come to the next doctor appointment and ask questions. He seams not to want to trust anyone but himself - if he is not willing to go to next appointment (because he doesn’t want to be told he is wrong) then he needs to butt out."

I was an exchange student in Germany at 16, I went out of state to college, I lived on my own in graduate school in another state. 

The earlier your daughter can learn to manage her diabetes, the more prepared she will be for when she’s not in your house anymore.  I also think that it will prepare you for when she’s not in your house anymore.

Edit to add:  you are doing a great job in getting your anxiety under control, and you should be really proud of yourself! Talking to my mom as an adult, she told me of the worry she had when I was diagnosed, which I never knew of. I feel like my parents acting like it’s something to deal with but not stress about really set me up well for dealing with my diabetes. It’s something that I deal with when I need to but otherwise I don’t worry about it."

**for you & your partner, it’s really important to not overreact if she makes a mistake — I was so afraid of getting in trouble because of ‘bad’ blood sugar that I had major burnout & an ED in my late teens/early twenties. Obviously can’t solely blame my parents for that but their influence definitely didn’t help. 

Check with your endo or local hospital for a T1D parents group - mine joined one when I was diagnosed and I think it was really helpful for them to have others that are translating doctor’s words into real world.

Also look into a T1D camp for your daughter if you can - they are huge for building confidence in managing diabetes & so cool to make friends that can fully relate to you."

For our youngest (8), we’re still doing site changes for the pump and dexcom (she doesn’t want to yet), but she does all her own carb counting, dosing, etc. Our oldest (15) does everything totally on his own outside of guidance when he asks for help or is struggling. It’s tough because we constantly worry about them, but my worry should not be their burden, and their diabetes is ultimately theirs to manage. The goal is to teach them how to do things and why so they can ultimately do everything themselves. I love them, but I don’t want them to live with me forever, and waiting until they’re adults to hand things over would be a complete disservice to them. Keep doing what you’re doing!"

Hopefully, there’s a cure in her lifetime, but I’ve learned to never bank on it, so this is something she’ll have to deal with in the long term. 

From everything you’ve mentioned, it sounds like both you and your partner love her and want the best for her, so maybe it’d be a good idea to find a therapist specializing in T1D kids (I had one myself as a kid and loved being able to see her on a weekly basis). You can check with her endo and see if they know of anyone in the area, because this seems like a good discussion to have with a third party who understands the nuances of a child living with T1D. She might also want someone to talk to during this time of her life- I don’t envy her, being T1D and a pre-teen/teenager was so hard and I’m so glad I personally had someone to talk to about things and get advice from."

My mom was intensely a helicopter mom with me and I genuinely feel like I've missed out on a LOT of opportunities because of it. I was given independence with her in control. Sure I could bolus myself and change my own pods, but I was much older than 11 (although at that age I was new to a pump and dexcom) but it was under her supervision with her carb counting for me, her doing the math for insulin and all of that stuff. I didn't start giving myself shots until I was 10, then started a pump and dexcom at 11, I didn't change my own pods and dexcoms til I was probably 12 or older and when I did it was with supervision. I wish more than anything that I would've been given more independence. I'm 17 now and still have never slept over at someone else's house. This is the most independence I've ever had. I got my drivers license about 6 months ago. Both of my parents are still very intense helicopters and it only makes me resent them. My A1C is the best it's been at 6.1 and it's with me taking care of my diabetes 99% of the time. You are absolutely doing the right thing for your daughter. Give her that freedom but also be a net, that's what parents are for. You push them when they need it, you let them have freedom and let them make mistakes but you stay there as a net to catch them when they need you. Encourage her to do it all herself but also be there to help when she's not feeling up to it. Ever since I've become so independent I've lost most support, I've heard from diabuddies that their parents still willingly change their pods when they want/need that help and I wish I had that. Id encourage you to allow your partner to read these comments and see how helpful this independence could be for her! Give her that freedom and watch her thrive, you may both be surprised by what she is capable of, she just needs that chance to show it. Good luck to you and your family OP!!"

I was so far up him bum for a while, but I realized early on I was causing him some anxiety issues. Then I (my husband told me I had to give him space) backed up a bit and let him take the lead slowly. 

And we did all those things because of those exact reasons that you stated in your last paragraph. I was also worried that if anything happened to me or my husband he wouldn’t be prepared to take care of himself. 

He’s now going to his friends pretty often since it’s summer. He has after school activities and sleep overs. I have access to his Dexcom and he has a phone where he can call me if he needs me. But I know that he is able to take care of himself and it put my mind at ease. 

We also have a rule that if any point in time he is just burnt out and having a day that all he has to do is come to us and say I’m having a day can you please take over and we will. 

I know it’s a lot for a kid, but I have also seen adults who’s parents did everything for them as a T1 and then we’re not able to function as an adult no longer in their parents home.

I don't think you're wrong, but your partner isn't either. I think there's a middle ground here where you both actually get everything you want. 

For you, you want your child to be able to manage their own diabetes, because it's going to be fully up to them at some point. You also don't want to prod too much and have her push back, especially as she becomes a teenager where she neglects her care from 15-22.

Your partner doesn't want anything bad to happen to her, and fears you ceding care increases those odds because she's still just a child.

The thing is, you can totally have both. You can have your daughter manage her care as much as she's comfortable, like you want but then just oversee it so you know nothing bad will happen to assuage your partner. 

The pump is a good example. It's expired, but has remaining insulin and had 6-7 hours left. You knew both of these things. Something bad will only happen if you're totally unaware and let her pump completely die leading to dka. But you knew you had time and your daughter did too (or you could at least remind her).

This is kind of like a Dexcom expiring and having a grace period. Maybe changing the pump right then and there would be inconvenient, and changing it before bed made more sense. 

Every child is different, but 11 is plenty reasonable to handle some level of care. Maybe when she boluses have her check with you first just to make him feel better. If she's spot on tell her, and tell your partner it's exactly how you would have bolused. Let them know that she's not just doing it, but doing it well. Let him know you're keeping an eye on her numbers, especially as hormones and puberty hit and may require more hands on care from you, etc."

If she has a CGM that allows it and she agrees, you could follow her BG and you would able to react if something goes really bad. But she needs to be 100% onboard with it.

As long as your daughter is continuing to be responsible and the decisions she's making are reasonable, I think you are right to trust her.

Of course, if she starts skipping insulin doses or something like that, you will have to step back in. A lot of diabetics go through a kind of denial phase, particularly in their teen years, so as she gets older you may have to revisit this system.

I think doing some kind of trust but verify system should work. Like I wouldn't leave it all on her. Trust her to manage it, but maybe you always make sure you have a tube of glucose tabs on you in case your daughter forgets one day. Or when you travel far from home let her pack her supplies, but just double check before you leave that she has backup insulin etc. So you are still trusting her to manage her own diabetes, but you are a fall back for her in case she misses something.  Let her know that Mom has her back if she makes a mistake - which she will, she's human - and that she has another person in her corner to help her (without judgement) if she needs it. If she has a CGM I would get the alerts sent to your phone as well. Don't nag her everytime her blood sugar is slightly high or low, but this way you can just kind of keep an eye out - like if she's been high for an extended period of time check in with her If she wants to try a pump change. Or if she goes low and night and you don't hear her wake up to eat a snack, go in and check on her.

This is a really difficult balance you are trying to strike and it sounds like you are doing an admirable job. Diabetes is a 24/7 job, and as a T1 myself, I know my diabetes better than anyone. Every time my mom or someone nags or second guesses me it makes we want to just lose my mind. It is really, really frustrating. But my situation was slightly different -I'm an adult now, and I was diagnosed at 16. I did my own testing and shots from the beginning. Neither of my parents has ever given me a shot. I doubt they'd know how to work my pump if they tried. They are wonderful and very supportive, but because they don't have the necessary knowledge, whenever they question me it is incredibly frusterating since they are coming at it from a place of relative ignorance. But I can't imagine being a parent of an 11 year old with diabetes. I would be very scared and anxious and would want to helicopter as well. All that is to say, I think you're doing a good job really thinking about this issue and not approaching it from a defensive posture. Your husband's reaction is natural, but it sounds like the three of you just need to sit down and talk. Being too pushy and aggressive with your daughter could cause her to withdraw and hide how her diabetes is going from you, and eventually not come to you if she is having a problem and does need help.

I completely agree with what the other commenters are saying about not reacting with anger is something goes wrong. It's okay to be scared and worried, but don't lash out. When you're diabetic being high or low can feel like a personal, almost moral failing. (especially when you're younger). For a long time I was so embarrassed when my A1c was bad. Being asked how your blood sugar is is kind of like being asked what your weight is. It took me may years to move past this way of thinking and not feel so much shame.

You don't want to make your daughter start feeling guilt and shame so she is unwilling to communicate openly with you, since she will still need your help. Even now as an adult sometimes my mom will hear my Dexcom alert and be like, ""well, why is your blood sugar high?"" in an accusatory way. It makes me want to just scream, ""because my pancreas doesn't work and sometimes this just happens!! Back off!"" You don't want to make your daughter feel that way."
Am I in the wrong? Parent of T1D,"Our daughter was diagnosed with T1 at 5 years old, she almost 11 now so it’s been close to 6 years she’s lived this life. In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older.

You are preparing her for the real world. Do we all wish that we could be squeaky clean diabetics who change their pod the minute we get the notification that it’s expired? Sure. However, it’s just not always feasible. By teaching her that she can handle this disease on her own (within reason), you are giving her the confidence that she will need as an adult. When I was diagnosed, my mom, who is also type 1, was sitting with me while I was sobbing, trying to put on my first Dexcom. I asked if she would do it for me, and she said that this is something I had to do on my own, and that I have to know how to do these things. 

You are doing an exceptional job and I think any medical provider would agree that you are setting her up for success. She’s going to be a confident, independent person!"

In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older.

He is 21 but I have left him in charge of his own care, like remembering to schedule his yearly scans and refill meds etc etc.  this is hard to let go of but so important for their future.

I've had T1D for 20 years, and it never hurts to review things like sick day protocol, making sure I have low sugars, and carb counting. Once she shows she can do it on her own (which it sounds like she has, maybe your partner just hasn't seen as much.)

Honestly, at that age she needs to be taking on the more routine pieces of care. However, as the parent you absolutely still have a role in helping her manage diabetes as her body and life change drastically.  There are harder things to manage on the horizon (choices all teenagers grapple with, she just has an extra set of consequences.)

You're on the right path, keep up the good work!"

You were once in his position. You know how it feels and how scary it was for you. Now imagine you were in that still anxious phase and he was doing things the way you are. How would you feel about it? 

While I’m not saying stop allowing her her independence, you need to see things from his side as well. 

I’d personally not allow her to continue to use an expired omnipod. We just got started with the tslim for my 6 year old. I am teaching him it needs changed the same time every day. I’m a single mom, so I’m the default parent too. I have taught him to read his own sugar, check his finger and treat his own lows. I allow him to choose if he wants to risk passing out or having a seizure or if he wants to eat the food I bolused for. I am giving him as much independence as I can, he was diagnosed a year ago.  I’m hoping he will learn how to bolus soon because the nursing company has told me we won’t get a nurse due to the shortage of nurses and me going to the school at lunch time every school day until he’s 12+ sounds like complete crap. I can’t live my life and I can’t do stuff with my toddler because I’m home waiting to go back to do his insulin. 

Continue to let her have her independence but if it makes things better with your husband get her to change her pod when it expires. If it makes your husband feel better and it needs changed anyway what’s the harm in having her change it as soon as it’s time? You’re just in a power struggle with him right now and it won’t harm her to change it a few hours earlier than “when she feels like it”."

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older. 

She will soon be a preteen and want to go do things with her friends that doesn’t involve us and I would hate for her to miss out on those kinds of things because she can’t take of herself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14o10gz/am_i_in_the_wrong_parent_of_t1d/,"I think you're doing great.

Another thing to consider is that there will inevitably be a crisis. No matter what you do, eventually there will be a circumstance that is far from ideal. You're setting her up to recognize them before they happen/get too bad, and to be a le to handle it if something does come up. The point is independence, not perfection."

In the past I have struggled with being hyper vigilant and the stereotypical “helicopter mom” x10 because of her diabetes. I am finally getting to a place where I can be less anxious, allowing her to live her life as a regular child for the most part and not constantly treating her as a “fragile” type 1 diabetic child. If you know what I mean? 

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older.

I was diagnosed at 12, and my parents let me do everything myself. This was in a time where much less technology existed, and I needed to take blood sugars, count carbs (or before that, exchanges), mentally calculate insulin doses, draw, and inject insulin. Technology makes things easier. Your daughter's Omnipod will calculate the correct dose (and possibly increase and decrease her insulin dose depending on version), and the dexcom can alarm to let you both know when there is an issue. I grew up responsible for managing my disease and was much better off because of it. Contrast that with my brother, who was diagnosed at 3.5 (he is 20 years younger than I am). My parents didn't give him the freedom to control his own disease and make his own mistakes. He just turned 26 and is still not fully independent. He will go to work without changing his reservoir on his pump and run out of insulin, has to be reminded to check his supplies before a trip, and goes days without replacing his Dexcom because it's too much work or he just doesn't want to change it. Overall, he still has pretty good control, but he can not be depended on to take care of himself. My parents were not good at giving up control (even though they tried to get him to take responsibility, they still hovered), partly because he has ADHD (this makes management of diabetes more challenging, but it is possible). You don't want your child to grow up unable to care for themselves.

My suggestion for you is to brainstorm with your husband all the concerns about what could go wrong when letting your daughter manage her own care. Definitely use Dexcom follow to alert you of problem blood sugars - I would set it slightly higher and lower than your daughter's alarms to give her an opportunity to solve any problems before you get involved. Personally, I carry an insulin pen with some needles in my purse at all times (I replace it on the first of each month). This way, I can't have a pump failure, rip out a set, run out of insulin, or any other issue without a way to recover. As I am handicapped and don't drive, I can't just head to a pharmacy, go home, or manage a crisis without pre-planning. Brain storming ways to deal with problems that *could* happen is much better than not being willing to let your daughter take over because there *might* be a problem. Even you and your husband can make mistakes - I can guarantee your daughter WILL make mistakes - it's all part of being human!! Carrying some sugar (glucose, fruit snacks, candy, whatever works for you) and having a plan of how to get insulin in an emergency can deal with most, if not all diabetes related mishaps. We have ALL taken too much insulin (even double doses or a long-acting dose of rapid-acting insulin), miscounted carbs, forgotten to take insulin, etc. Life is not about preventing mistakes from happening; it's learning how to properly respond when they do. 

I completely understand your husband's fears of letting go. This is perfectly normal. Letting go is also essential to raising a healthy, well-adjusted daughter who can take care of herself! Examining the fears you have and coming up with solutions is the best way to keep your daughter safe. Letting an expired pod run for a couple of hours to utilize more of the insulin isn't an issue, unless you need to go somewhere in a rush and don't have time to change it (a pod at the end of its normal life span could have the same issue). If your daughter needs your help to change sites, then respecting your schedule is important, but it doesn't sound like this is the issue.

It sounds like your daughter is doing great with taking on the responsibilities of her disease. This is an important step, and it's good that you are giving her this opportunity to grow. Perfection isn't possible, for you or for her, so mitigating risks is the best way to ease your and your husband's fears. It also will help your daughter learn to do the same for her future. Having a vial of insulin and a replacement pod at school, her best friend's home, grandma's, etc and both rotating and replacing supplies can be of great help - many diabetics have had issue with a pump failure at work making them leave 'sick', when preparation could easily have prevented problems!"

My anxiety and hovering was so severe that it caused my daughter to start showing signs of high anxiety + attacks and being overly cautious of everything in her life. I knew then that I had to get this under control and I worked hard to do that.

I am also the default parent so I am the one handling the more serious situations and device issues, etc. so I have lots more experience with this than my partner. He is still more on the anxious side of dealing with her diabetes. Kind of in helicopter dad mode, similar to how I used to be. It’s not entirely his fault because he is away for work often in his career and his jobs last anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks. 

Anyways, the issue here is that my partner doesn’t feel comfortable with the fact that I am starting to allow our daughter be more independent with her diabetes care. She will bolus herself for meals without help if she doesn’t ask for it, and I leave it up to her when she changes her devices (omnipod + CGM) because she has lived with them every day for the last 6 years. 

Example, her pod is right now considered“expired” but my daughter is aware that her pod still has 25+ units of insulin and will still work for 4-7hrs so she doesn’t want to change it. I have allowed her to make that choice for a while now and her father absolutely hates it. He says I’m being neglectful and it’s going to result in a crisis that could’ve been avoided. I want to note that since I let her start taking charge of her care, there hasn’t been a single “crisis” or incident that could be blamed on my lack of attention or care, or my daughters.

He doesn’t believe we should trust her because of her age, but I would argue that she is much more aware and understanding of her needs than we are sometimes, when it comes to her diabetes. Our relationship is strong and we are great together, except for this one thing. For him the argument is a big enough issue that it impacts our relationship and it kills me.

I just really want to know if I’m being difficult and should not allow this anymore for his comfort as a T1 parent just like me, or if maybe he should realize that it’s time to let her have more responsibility and control of her diabetic care because she is getting older.

""This is a very good read and well performed, reviewed and substantiated study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857579/ (You can just skip to the results part if you want to see what the insulin did after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of 12H cycles from 25->37C and back again. (Spoiler: no change.) And then read on to see what happens when they keep the temperature above 31C and 37C constantly. It’s quite interesting how the cycling makes such a major difference. 

The goal was to prove refrigeration in the field isn’t necessary in tropical climates for the 4-weeks general use time after opening long as it goes back in temperature at night. They proved that, and then some… :)"""
Heat and Insulin,A general reminder to all that temps above 100F can render many insulins inactive.  Please take precautions to avoid such temps in your pumps and with any backup pens or vials!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14obnk9/heat_and_insulin/,"It does not take long to denature insulin in heat.  Might I suggest freezing a few wet cloths before being outside and then using those to place over the omnipod. Sports arm bands can help hold that in place. Or when outside for prolonged time go off pump and use a long acting insulin.  

At least if your BGs do not come down with insulin doses after being outside in heat, you will know why."

Help with my sugars! Insulin isn't working as well?,"I'm fairly newly diagnosed, November last year, and I'm a 17 year old male now struggling with my sugar levels.

I used to frequent 100% in range, it wasn't honeymoon as that ended mid march, at least that's what my endo said.

Anyways lately my sugars have just been crazy out of whack, like I take my usual carb bolus and it just doesn't work, I've been going high a lot and for long amounts of time. 

For example my ratio is 1:10 but for dinner I had 40g carbs, took 6 units, went to 15mmol! And took 4 more and it has only gone down to 10mmol.

Help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14oadwy/help_with_my_sugars_insulin_isnt_working_as_well/,"Take a few deep breaths. Diabetes is unfortunately not as simple as “this is my carb ratio and it will work perfectly every single time”. There are a TON of variables that impact blood sugars. It’s very well possible you were still in the honeymoon phase while you were 100% in range, this isn’t sustainable for most people - especially not teenagers. If you find you’re needing more insulin, then lower your carb ratio and test it out for a week or two. It’s also possible it was the carb content - 40 carbs of salad isn’t the same as 40 carbs of pizza. It will take time to figure it out, and it’s very possible you’ll never hit that “100% all the time” that you were right after diagnosis (I know I’m not!). It’s not about perfection, it’s about making small changes until you get it mostly right. Then making more changes as needed. It’s not your fault, it’s just diabetes. I would encourage you to not expect perfection, as that’s an easy way to get burnt out. I would also maybe look into getting a therapist who is familiar with chronic illness, your endo might be able to point you in the right direction. Best of luck!"

Am I alone in this? Have I just gotten supremely lucky with all of my G7s?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14o21pm/dexcom_g7_i_genuinely_like_it/,CGMs are imperfect! There is no CGM which exists right now that is not going to fail or have issues. You should tailor your devices to your needs and tastes but I like the G7. Do what you need to feel safe <3
Dexcom G7 - I Genuinely Like It,"I’ve not seen even one positive post about the G7 since its launch, so I was dubious about trying it. After holding my endo hostage in the office for 30 minutes to unleash a barrage of questions about it, my endo gave me two sensors to try, and I truly liked it, so I changed my prescription. 

I used the G6 for 5 years (after 13 years of finger sticks and a horrible year with Medtronic’s early CGM beast) before trying the G7, and I can earnestly say that I like the G7 more.

The thingy getting bent, adhesive falling off, banging sensors on doorways, those things are going to happen unfortunately. None of these devices are 100% yet. I’m so glad that you’re finding them useful, though! I couldn’t be happier that the days of finger sticks are quickly becoming ancient history.

I wish you the best of luck!"
Anyone have issues with the g7?,"My little one has had the g7 for a few months now. We have had more failed sensors than successful ones. Still love the fact that it's fewer finger pokes, but being out and having a sensor fail, or getting ""brief sensor issue"" on a consistent basis has been an issue. Dexcom is great, and keeps sending replacements, but I was curious if anyone else has had similar issues? The g6 is bigger, but seems like it is more stable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nvu1z/anyone_have_issues_with_the_g7/,"Yep, I’ve had many issues when I had it. I tried out the G7 for two months and hated every second of it: the sensor ripped out three times ( twice on my arm and once on my stomach), had two sensors fail or just not connect and had horrible inaccuracy - I ended up finger pricking more then looking at the receiver. I loved how small and discreet it was but I much prefer the G6 and how accurate I’ve personally found it ( I’ve used the G6 for over a year now ). Although the G7 was supposed to be revolutionary, I personally found it worse then finger pricks."

Did you vision correction change after being diagnosed?,"I was diagnosed with Type 1 my junior year of high school. A week after my diagnosis, short hospital stay, and treatment bringing my blood sugar to a normal range; I put my contacts in as usual and my vision was blurry.

A week passed and for a few days I didn't wear glasses or contacts and was able to see just fine. Slowly but surely my vision returned to my regular corrected prescription requirement. 

To this day no eye doctor or Endo has been able to explain it adequately. I had needed corrective lenses for years before my diagnosis.

It’s something to do with a sudden change in the blood glucose affecting the fluid in your eyes I think. Once the fluid is back to “normal” composition your vision goes back to “normal”.

I was so panicked that I rang the optician and they said they wouldn’t see me for a few weeks after diagnosis/starting medication as your vision is so unstable. I just wanted to be cleared to drive."

For the last 30 years I’ve had a fairly stable Rx for distance but now no longer need it.  Actually told eye doctor “ I think diabetes made my vision better”.

This causes them to slightly change shape. After diagnosis you return to normal hydration status rapidly. This rapid change is difficult for your body to account for thus the blurry (or in your case corrected) vision. It eventually goes back to your normal status after you body compensates.

Vision can do some really strange things with changes in glucose levels. It's disturbing how many medical professionals either aren't aware of this, or just don't mention it."
Did you vision correction change after being diagnosed?,"I was diagnosed with Type 1 my junior year of high school. A week after my diagnosis, short hospital stay, and treatment bringing my blood sugar to a normal range; I put my contacts in as usual and my vision was blurry. I took them out and did an experiment with my glasses. I put them on - blurry, off - perfect vision, on - blurry again, off - 20/20. It felt just like that scene in Spider-Man 1 where Peter realizes he doesn't need glasses anymore after the spider bite. A week passed and for a few days I didn't wear glasses or contacts and was able to see just fine. Slowly but surely my vision returned to my regular corrected prescription requirement.

Interestingly for me leading up to my diagnosis my vision actually got better. I stopped wearing my contacts for a while because the high blood sugars improved my vision. Once I got them back down it went back to normal and I went back to wearing my contacts again.

I had just been diagnosed.  I was also having blurry vision.  I went to the eye appointment, and they recommended not getting glasses because of the recent diagnosis because my vision would likely change as my glucose levels corrected.  So he recommended contacts.  I did that.  I used them for a week or two (this was 1997 - I don't remember exactly but it wasn't long) when I realized that my vision was worse with them in than with them out.  So I stopped wearing them.  Sure enough, my vision corrected itself."

It didn’t occur to me to take off my glasses so I don’t know if that would have made a difference.  I went to an ophthalmologist who told me it was due to my BG being so high for so long and it was now coming down.  He assured me I wasn’t going blind and it would correct itself shortly, which it did.

The endo in the hospital never even mentioned this might happen."

BS spikes with meat,"Why does my BS always spike when I have no carb meals, like chicken wings or sausage etc., even with no sauces or sides? Any advice on avoiding this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nyvht/bs_spikes_with_meat/,"It’s gluconeogenesis ( your body converts protein into glucose) . I am T1D and eat low carb, primarily meat ,veggies , limited dairy. You still have to bolus for the protein, and yes it’s tough and all trial and error. Read about it, it’s pretty interesting. 

I’m on a pump and I run a higher temp basal after I eat meat for 2-3 hours to avoid the spike, it helps me. A lot of people might split dose and bolus some before meal and some after. 

Fwiw- If I don’t do it right I’m 200 as well. For me it’s tiny boluses and increased temp basal. Good luck. You’ll figure it out!  

Some helpful websites/podcasts include Juicebox Podcast ( they have an entire episode on bolusing for protein) and Dr. Bernstein’s The Diabetes Solution.

Chicken, beef ,pork , eggs all affect me differently . When I started low carb someone once told me a rough estimate is to add up the protein and cut that number in half, bolus for that."

Other proteins- maybe you are just sensitive to protein. In the absence of carbs the body will utilise protein for fuel by essentially turning it into glucose. 

It is part of the process behind keto diets: the body stops using carbs and uses and burns fats and protein for fuel instead. Protein, therefore, can cause a rise in blood sugar (it is usually a delayed reaction, not as fast as carbs because it takes time for the body to change protein cells into glucose. It is also usually a slower and steadier raise in blood sugar compared to absorption of carbs.)

How much does your BG increase over two to three hours when you eat the protein only meal? You might find you need an insulin dose to control the rise.

…

Otherwise… is your basal rate dialled in correctly? Would you rise if you didn’t eat the meal at all? You might need a bigger basal dose (or split morning and night)"

The new CGM/Pump combos are supposed to be able to handle slow rises in blood sugar caused by high protein/fat meals (I am converting to one shortly - I have older one that does a bad job with this). Older pumps had a square bolus for meats and stuff (6 units square bolus = 2 units now, 2 units in an hour, and finally 2 units after 2 hours - except a little more elegant than that)."

Still mad about my diagnosis 26 years later…,"I want to share my diagnosis story and see if anyone else has dealt with something like this. Sorry if I start rambling…

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this.

It makes me incredibly mad whenever I read a story in the new about a kid who nearly died because it took so long to diagnose them.  Like, meters are available everywhere and strips aren’t that expensive.  Why doesn’t every doctor’s office have one?  They should do a finger stick test on everyone no matter hat the reason for their visit is.  They take your temperature, weigh you, blood pressure.  A finger poke should also be standard.  

It’s not like Type 1 is some rare, little known condition.  Everyone knows the classic symptoms.  Why do doctors immediately think of a “bug” when a parent says their kid is drinking and peeing and puking and lethargic all the time?  Use a fucking meter on the kid!

I did not have a traumatic diagnosis and I was 19, but it pisses me off when doctors don’t think of such an obvious diagnosis/test for such classic symptoms.  I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 2.  My mother said she took me to the pediatrician who told her I “just wanted attention”.  She found a new pediatrician."

I was 17 at diagnosis, in the custody of the state of Arizona. I remember being seen by a doctor for a physical of some sort and they said to me “there’s so much sugar in your urine”, I said “I drink a lot of mountain dew 🤷🏻‍♀️”. A few months later and I’m down to 78lbs, living in a youth shelter, starving, dying of thirst. I would do the same thing with the bathroom faucet because the shelter staff were scared I was going to give myself water poisoning. I could only get water when I was in the bathroom! 

After taco night, I laid down on the couch in the front room of the shelter and woke up in the ER. Blood sugar was 1180, A1c was 22. The glucose-filled urine was 4 months prior. I’m so grateful to still be alive. I didn’t have family looking out for me, parents taking me to the doctor, asking what was wrong. I was shuffled from youth shelter to group home and back and no one really knew me well enough to know something was wrong. They knew I had a history of trauma and assumed I was dealing with anorexia as well. 

I’m now an emergency room social worker and I take such peace and comfort in knowing how much more educated physicians and hospitals etc are now, and blood glucose is checked so quickly even when diabetes isn’t a suspicion just to be sure.

I was 13 at diagnoses and i was easily drinking 3 liters of water a day for 3 months. then because my sugars were so high i stopped drinking purified water because it tasted sweet and i was only drinking tap water. getting up to drink water was the only thing that could get me out of bed or off the couch i was in that incredibly lethargic state for about 2 weeks until my mom decided that something was seriously wrong with me. she decided that i had to go to the er. when we got there my bg was 817mg/dl and the er doctor told me that if we hadn’t come in i would have had 2 hours to live which was incredibly scary for a 13 year old in severe dka. before passing out in the hospital bed i remember saying to my mom “am i dying mom?”

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this.

That's just awful, and your dad was force feeding you and making you drink Boost. I'm so sorry.  

I have to always check myself because my own mother was kind of Munchausen-by-proxy-ish and had me at doctors and in the hospital a lot doing tests and stuff. What was wrong with me was likely her. So I worry that I may be overreacting with my own kid and have to force myself to hold my ground about worries for them."

I do remember going on holiday in the summer & feeling really ill while I was there; turns out I had rubella. I seemed to get better but never got back to 100% health. I know I was taken to the doctors loads of times but was told she still recovering from rubella give her a tonic, it’s a tummy upset, gastric flu, a random virus. I’ve only got 2 vivid memories; one of being in the bathroom drinking out the bathroom tap whilst peeing into to toilet at the same time. I literally couldn’t get enough water down my throat & even though I had water in my mouth my mouth feeling really dry. The other is being in my Mum & Dads bed hearing my Mum crying & a strange man in a uniform saying the word insulin & diabetic. I’d fallen into a coma & parents had called an ambulance; the paramedic knew the minute he walked in the bedroom cos he could smell the ketones. I was in hospital (over Christmas) for about 2 months & in intensive care for 2 weeks. My parents were told to say their goodbyes as everyone was sure I wouldn’t survive. I’m still here kicking diabetes into touch (and with no complications!) proving everyone wrong. Diabetes has never stopped me doing anything I want - in fact the more I’m told I can’t do something the more I try to hardest to do it! 

We are amazingly lucky with todays modern tech & advances being made; the survival rate long term for those with type 1 is very good provided we control it & the new tech makes that so much easier. 

I’m often asked if you could choose not to be a diabetic anymore would you? I always answer no! I don’t remember not being a diabetic & I’ve achieved a lot of things in my life because of diabetes that I possibly wouldn’t have attempted because no one would have said “oh diabetics can’t do that”

Is it a pain in the arse? God yes! Does it piss me off at times? Of course it does. But me being angry or sad about it doesn’t make it go away; it just ruins the time we have left & God knows there’s precious little of that for anyone! We’re all in the same queue heading towards the grave; you can either stand quietly in the queue waiting for your turn or join the party at the side & dance your way there."

Our diagnosis stories are actually similar. Before diagnosis, I was slightly heavy. I wasn’t overweight but medical standards but had a little tummy and as everyone knows as a 10 year old girl people start focusing on your weight. I remember the summer right before I was diagnosed people at a cabin we used to be at started commenting that I was thinning out and that puberty was going to be a blessing for me. Jeeze. Over the fall I slowly started to get symptoms. I had just started 6th grade and my mom started taking me to my pediatrician. I felt okay until late October when I got strep. I think strep is the thing that broke the camels back and really spurred my type 1 into motion. Over the next two months my mom took me to the same doc I had since I was born. He reiterated to my mom over and over again that I had social issues- I was acting out because I was starting a new school. Meanwhile my math teacher had a conference with my parents because he noticed I was losing weight rapidly and thought I was anorexic. Like you- didn’t know what that meant. My parents actually pulled me aside to ask if I was eating or if I was eating and puking because I was eating all the time. Thanksgiving happens and I’m still not too. Two weeks later I’m in full blown dka and I remember waking up and telling my mom I’m not going to school or I’m going to vomit. We fought because at this point she’s trying to believe me but doctors that she worked with (she used to be a medical assistant) told her I was fine. What ultimately led to my diagnosis is the day I stayed home, I took a bath. I was so weak and had been vomiting all day. My mom helped me to the tub and since I was 11 it was the first time she had seen me with clothes off. I was so thin you could see every bone. We rushed to a new doc, he smelt my breath and ordered all the tests you can think of. After like ten minutes he walks in and im like half awake on the bed and he goes I don’t want to tell you this but your daughter is a type 1 diabetic and she has to go to the hospital now as she’s in dka. He literally saved my life. To this day, I still don’t fully trust doctors but am such a strong advocate for myself."

I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this.

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

I was diagnosed at 16. At the time I had mono and was losing weight and going blind. I was thirsty all the time and pissing constantly. I went to my doctor multiple times and he would say it was mono side effects. Classic diabetes symptoms just written off. He would then advise my parents behind my back that I had an eating disorder. After a month of this one morning I could barely get out of bed. I went to the ER and a nurse without half the training as my doctor diagnosed me. My blood sugar was over 700. 
   Fuck doctors, they have a god complex. Now that I’m diagnosed they are still no help. Most are deaf and blind to ANY issues you have. In the US they are part of the for-profit medicine “game” and just as guilty as insurance companies who put profits before people. 

I’m looking at you, Joslin Diabetes Clinic… greedy worthless fucks."

Anyone else have a shitty road to their diagnosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nibw5/still_mad_about_my_diagnosis_26_years_later/,"I was 32, pregnant for the first time with twins, married for almost a year. I have always fluctuated with weight. I've been skinny and fat. When we went for our 9 week scan, baby A didn't have a heartbeat. Tough to hear, but was told that can happen with twins and many women lose a twin before their first scan and never knew they were even carrying twins. Asked about baby B and if they were OK. Doc said yes and everything should go well from here. At about 12 to 14 weeks, I was dropping a little weight. Not great when pregnant, but it was just a few pounds. Again, doc wasn't worried. I noticed I was thirsty more and peeing more, but of course Google said it happens in first trimester. Now at about 16 to 17 weeks, I really started to get thirsty. At about 18 1/2 weeks, I told my mom how I couldn't really quench my thirst and Popsicles seemed the only thing that could actually quench the thirst. She said, I think that happens with diabetes. I told her my glucose test was at 20 weeks. We both thought to wait till then. BIG MISTAKE. At 19 weeks and 1 day, I went pee. When I wiped, I noticed this odd mucus thing. Went to bed and at 6 am, I felt a gush. Went to the bathroom and knew something wasn't right. The water was clear and didn't smell like pee. Soon after contractions started. My husband took us to the hospital. Sure enough, I was in labor and there was no saving our son. I was told ""this is just bad luck"" and 1 in 4 women will miscarry. I said I was really thirsty before this happened, could that be why? Told nope, bad luck. Gave birth to Hunter shortly after. That was by far the most horrific moment of my life. Knowing that my son was gone and it was my bad luck. Went for my post partem check up and again asked what could have caused this. Again, was told it happens and we can try again. Had endo appointment for my thyroid. They decided since I just miscarried to do a full metabolic panel

There in the papers was the cause...Antibodies through the God damn roof, blood sugar 485 and A1C was 13. My doc basically said, when I got pregnant, my immune system went complete batshit and instead of attacking the babies, it went to my pancreas and inihalated it. Type 1 caused my thirst, weight loss and possibly miscarriage. So on top of losing my son, I also got a life long uncurable disease...not what I was expecting at all. Devastated on top of guilt that there were signs and I missed them all. I switched gynos after that. Had a healthy baby boy later that year. Pre term birth happened again, but my new gyno knew that this pregnancy was perfect and my A1C was 5.9 the whole time.

By the time my next son was born, she knew in her gut that I may not make enough progesterone. So at 18 weeks til labor I got a weekly shot to try to keep my baby cooking. Thankfully, my third pregnancy and third son was born just a few days shy of induction date of 37 weeks. Both are healthy and currently diabetes free at 8 and 5 years old.

I'm still pissed I'm a T1D, pissed I knew NOTHING and pissed that this damn disease is my door prize for my ignorance. But even with all that, it doesn't control me like it once did. Having a pump really helps to put it more at the back of my mind then the forefront. This disease is tough and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But I have it and it's not going anywhere. I gotta roll with it and suck up the fact that we will always be shelling out a crapton of money to have insurance and to keep me alive. 

I just feel really lucky to have been able to have 2 great little boys who drive me bonkers and fill my entire world. I will always desperatley love and miss my Hunter. I wish we had more time with him, but through the loss of him, I understand how to be your own advocate. I will NEVER make that mistake again. I will fight to be heard and if the answers I'm getting don't make sense, I will seek out more somewhere else. Especially with T1D. I know me and I know T1D effects every person differently. Be your own advocate and fight for yourself."

I was diagnosed with celiac disease just before my 5th birthday. My mom is a nurse who works in a school and worked with a lot of kids with T1D and celiac so she was secretly watching me really closely after my celiac diagnosis. Sure enough, 6 months later I was drinking a lot and peeing a lot, the big sign was I would have ""pee nightmares"" where I would wake up SCREAMING and completely unable to say what was wrong til they figured out I needed to pee, my dad got peed on a couple times... oops, sorry dad. I was taken to my pediatrician and I was 419 and they told my parents to go home and pack a bag then rush me to the hospital as they would be ready for us, we were told to prepare for a week or so there. My diagnoses were weird, most people are diagnosed with T1D then celiac but I was the opposite. My mom said my big signs were that I hadn't grown or gained any weight at all in over a year because of both diagnoses. We spent a weekend in the hospital, not super long because my mom was already trained on shots and everything, I was sent home on Halloween day, my parents definitely had to say no to trick or treating that year. It's been almost 12 years now and im still here and still fighting. It has never once been easy and I'm sure everyone can agree it'll never get easier, but we all learn how to navigate our new life. So for anyone newly diagnosed reading this just know it's not the end of the road. You will learn how to manage it and not allow it to rule your life. Does that mean it'll be easy? Hell no, it never fails to be a pain in the ass. It's okay to have hard days, it's okay to cry and just want to give up, maybe even bad weeks too. Diabetes gets thrown on the back burner sometimes and that's okay. I'm currently bouncing back from having a couple weeks of awful numbers, I was at 37% in range for a couple days. It'll all be okay, you will learn how to adjust to your new life and everyone around you who is worth while will be there to help you learn that new life as well. Good luck on your new adventure! And good job to you OP, keep fighting!"

I can't imagine the addition of being so young and not really being able to fully understand post diagnosis the implications of not being able to have birthday cake or ice cream at a party (without a special insulin adventure to make me look different). 

I was 33 and in the middle of an international adoption. In that process a complete physical is required. That included an A1c and it was 5.3. Meant nothing to me other than the word ""normal"" next to it.  For years I tried on/off to lose the 15 pounds I'd gained since college.

My brother in law was getting married and I declared ""no dieting at the wedding events"". When I got home I had lost 4 pounds. Suck it diet, see what happens when I ignore you?

Then I continued to lose weight.  It was weird but otherwise young and healthy/fit. And we didn't want to upset the adoption process. So my wife would try to fatten me up with pie. She would always have one around and it (was) one of my favorite things per diagnosis. And had been off the menu for a long time bc of the diet. 

Weight loss piled on and so did the thirst and peeing and feeling generally wiped out. Water tasted delicious. Skin started to get randomly itchy in places. 

By about 90 days after that A1c, I had lost 45 pounds. I  was 140 pounds and clothes were hanging off me. It happened very quickly and people at work started asking if I was ok. So back to Dr. I don't have a record of the A1c but he diagnosed me as T2 and put me on glimepride with and referred me to the Portland Diabetes and Endocrinology Center (shout out to a the home or the best doctor I have ever had of a total of 8).  Soonest they could see a new patient was a few more weeks. 

But at least I could moderate what I ate (I didn't know enough to effectively manage with my still in honeymoon phase pancreas. I could have managed knowing what I know now after having lived a few years with it in honeymoon.   I have told a lot of people how grateful I am for not having had this burden until after college.  I would have struggled for sure with maintaining anything like a normal blood sugar level in those years based on my earliest competency and knowing what my peer group lifestyle was. 

I'm now 180, ~10 pounds over my college weight.  With a closed loop insulin pump and a lot of work stress I had reached 208 before getting serious about paying close attention to which foods were contribution do digestion or blood sugar spikes. CGM technology, (dexcom, etc) have made this possible. There's only so many finger pricks you can give yourself and the strips aren't free. 

I am also fortunate to have never been in the ER due to diabetes. After about 2 years from diagnosis, I went onto a minimed pump. Great experience and solid technology. They were acquired by Medtronic who continued to innovate and had one of the first closed loop systems. I eventually grew to despise it.  It would alarm constantly, otter right after I callibrated telling it my finger stick was considerably higher than it was. I told it. And then two minutes later when I'd just started to think about something else than the headache of being diabetic, the pump helpfully would inform that blood sugar was too high. Can't ignore the pump, gotta bust it out and silence the alarm. Tubing would catch on doorknobs.  They were always prompt with replacement matters and not unreasonable ever.  But the quality seemed to slide, or my tolerance for the annoyances of it exceeded the benefit I felt I was getting.

I switched to omnipod dash, now onmipod5 and dexcom6 using Fiasp fast acting insulin.  Game changing.  

 I manage to a A1c that ranges between 5.8-6.8. I eat a low carb diet. I walk the dog 4-8 miles per day.  I drink no alcohol. I am in range 70-85 percent of the time but pust lunch is hard for me. Haven't cracked that code without suffering an evening low - if anyone read this far and has ideas, I'm listening. My diet is primarily, protein, vegetables, water coffee (with cream) nuts and cheese and berries.  Very rarely stone fruits.  I will eat ice cream in evening occasionally. This doesn't cause a spike for me with a correct bolus. Carbs from carbohydrate outside of the above is less than 30 per day excepting glucose to treat a low."
Still mad about my diagnosis 26 years later…,"I want to share my diagnosis story and see if anyone else has dealt with something like this. Sorry if I start rambling…

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this. 

Anyone else have a shitty road to their diagnosis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nibw5/still_mad_about_my_diagnosis_26_years_later/,"I was 30. I had just had my fifth child and I has gestational diabetes with her. They told me that it was likely I’d develop type 2 in later life so watch myself. I kept getting yeast infections and experienced a level of exhaustion I couldn’t comprehend, but chalked it up to 5 kids including a newborn. My vision was often blurry and I would sleep frequently during the day. My doctor kept checking my urine, but after 6 months of symptoms he finally ordered a blood test. Then a diagnosis of type 2. 5 months after that, another blood test and a diagnosis amendment to type 1. I was never hospitalized or taught how to deal with type 1, I had taken several classes on type 2. It’s been a shit show since and has left me pretty bitter about this disease and the way I’ve been treated over it. I lost jobs because of it, I’ve lost so much. I’m glad now there’s pumps and cgms, to be diagnosed now is much kinder, you get a lot of options for better control. I started on pork insulin, and had really no idea how to carb count, so when I look back I cringe at how badly I mangled controlling things, and the doctors I looked towards for help let me just hanging and got mad when my A1C was over 8…if you have a good support system, cherish it. If you don’t, please try to get a good team going, I was so lost and fell through so many cracks, it’s amazing I’m alive to type this tbh…"

This hit me like a brick, my mom said this too. I was 9 when diagnosed and turning 30 this year. And yeah, people with diabetes have hormone irregulation, this causes emotion regulation issues, which is often misdiagnosed as bipolar or if you also have ADHD, borderline. You probably don't have this, you just show symptoms of it since these are the same symptons diabetes causes but aren't used as a rule out for the others. I have ADHD too and was misdiagnosed with borderline, I don't have the key symptoms but I had enough of the overall symptoms to still get the diagnosis, the therapy worked and I got a job where they can't fire me over emotional outburst out of it but every other psychologist I spoke to told me they don't believe I really have the disorder, but since I got some positive stuff out of it, revoking it will cause more harm then good. 

I didn't go six months without diagnosis, it took 3 weeks, my doctor said I had a stomach flue, idiot didn't even tell her to take me in, he just diagnosed me over the phone, now I get how he also didn't think about cancer last year, dumbed his ass after that one, so after a week of being sick on the first vacation, then sick at home for two weeks, my mom said we weren't cancelling the second vacation since I could be sick there too. So they stuck me in a car and took the whole family to the beach 3 hours away. Once there, my mom stuck me on the couch and went to the beach with my sisters. Leaving my dad and me behind to wait for his best friend and family. So the friend got there, he had seen me a month prior, healthy, and said that this wasn't something I should sick out at home. IDK how it went from there, I remember sitting in some docs office who kept asking me questions I couldn't answer because I felt like shit. Eventually I woke up in the hospital, IDK how long I was out, but I was hooked up, everyone crying and still felt like crap. Then they came in with an insuline pen and told me they had to stab me with it. Not explaining to the dumb 9 year old that they still had to put a needle on there so I freaked the fuck out since I thought they where going to stab me with a thick fucking pen lol. So another traumatic event later, I was treated, brought to the hospital in my home town and made aware with the doctors there."

It seems it was months before my mom took me to see a doctor. It was summer time and I would lay in front of a big fan eating nothing but Mentos, fading away... My parents even dragged me and the whole family to a water park one day. She was upset I wasn't going on anything. I felt like I was going to puke and pass out.

High blood sugar. Blood sugar, something I'd soon become very familiar with.

The doctor I went to was a good one and sent me right away to get blood drawn. When my mom got the call from the doctors office, they said I'd need to be admitted to the hospital. I spent a week in the hospital- overwhelmed with information given to me and injecting oranges.

Still mad about my diagnosis 26 years later…,"I want to share my diagnosis story and see if anyone else has dealt with something like this. Sorry if I start rambling…

I’m 36 years old now, but when I was 10 years old I was diagnosed with Type 1. I was a kind of chubby, short girl in fifth grade. One day I wasn’t really hungry and didn’t eat. I thought it was pretty strange, but over time I just felt nauseous all the time and felt like I couldn’t eat. (A lot of people say they were overly hungry before being diagnosed. I was the opposite.) I was always exhausted and thirsty. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink water out of my bathroom faucet. Of course I had to pee ALL the time.

My parents were obviously worried about me and took me to my pediatrician. I actually went a few times during a six month period, and each time he told my parents that I was anorexic. At that age, I didn’t even know what that meant. I went from about 100 pounds to 64 pounds in six months. My arms and legs were like little twigs. I still had a slightly chubby stomach because I’ve always carried my weight there. I DID enjoy that I wasn’t the chubby girl anymore, but I have since had major insecurities about my fluctuating weight. I had a teacher who gave me morning detention one time (before diagnosis) because I had to go pee during class and I couldn’t hold it. My mom went in the next day and raised hell. She told my teacher something was going on and we couldn’t figure it out. 

Then one day, my pediatrician thought it might be a good idea to do a urinalysis. And guess what? I was spilling a ton of glucose in my urine. He then decided to do a blood test and immediately sent me to the hospital. My blood sugar was 496 that night, then 46 the next morning. I got to go home that next day, but felt really bad about the six year-old in the next room who was there for like two months. But my parents did buy me a Tamagotchi while in the hospital, so that was kind of cool. Oh, did I mention this was one week before Halloween? 😅

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs since then… a lot of stupid choices and not caring about myself. I’ve gone through many self-destructive phases where I ended up in the hospital multiple times. The other day my mom told me that around the time I started getting sick, I changed from a slightly shy but bubbly happy kid into a sad shell of my former self. That really bummed me out honestly. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder and anxiety as an adult, and I wonder if there is some sort of connection?

Anyways… At this point, I’m just rambling. But it still infuriates me that a children’s doctor who deals with diabetes and knows what it is brushed off my symptoms for SIX MONTHS. That time period was hell for me. My dad was so worried about me, and he would basically force feed me at the dinner table if I wasn’t eating. He made me drink Boost all the time. He was SO stressed and upset and I felt guilty that I was the cause of it. I just gave away my food at school because I just couldn’t stomach it. Six months. I’m still completely baffled by this.

With my blood sugar normally going to 500 every day I am now paying the price for being misdiagnosed in a terrible way. After getting a new doctor (and surprise) finding out I am actually type 1 I struggled keeping things in control even with the help of insulin. About a year ago I got approved for the tslim and Dexcom and that shit has completely changed my life. Side note; after I found out I was type 1 I was very upset at the first doctor who misdiagnosed me and decided to pay him a visit. When I got there it turns out he had died because he had cancer that he didn’t know about. Only tho g I could think was what a shitty doctor. Anyways happy you got things under control; 110 is wayyyy better than 250!!

It's not you, its diabetes. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14n7c12/its_not_you_its_diabetes/,The tl:dr of my diabetes journey (27 years) started with endos like that. Esp ones who wouldn’t listen. Which resulted in me having hypo seizures constantly. Now decades later I’m afraid to take enough insulin and my average numbers are around 230. It’s horrific.  So many complications. If ANYONE had bothered to show me grace and kindness in those first ten years I’d be so so much healthier.

If you are Insulin rationing - novolog has free short term Insulin they will do for you.

You can call novolog straight up about their different programs they have. 1-844-Novo4Me (1-844-668-6463)

Afrezza Insulin has different programs you can [View here](https://afrezza.com/savings-program/)

Also - if you are game to switch brands of Insulin - sanofi brand Insulin has good programs available (I’ve taken both apidra and admelog for short term from them)

https://www.teamingupfordiabetes.com/sanofidiabetes-savings-program

Humalog/ Lilly also has a patient assistance program you can try. To me humalog and novolog are Interchangeable but YMMV.

You can also check with state Medicaid and look into the healthcare.gov for Insurance plans in the mean time. If you are under income (it’s much higher  than I expected too) you can get your Insurance subsidized through the federal government.

If you have just left a job or lost Insurance coverage - look into COBRA - [COBRA information ](https://www.goodrx.com/insurance/health-insurance/cobra-health-insurance)

Many times doctors offices will give samples of insulin away as well. If you can, get your doc to write you a script for a couple extra bottles a filling so you can stockpile a bit if needed. 

Walmart sells R and NPH for $25 a bottle without a script in most states. They act differently than other medication but can work. Many, including myself, used these before the more modern Insulins were available but please do your research on how to use. 

Www.goodrx.com can help you look for cheaper places around you. May not be cheap, but can possibly help you find a cheaper place. 

https://costplusdrugs.com/ also has discount RX drugs. They don’t do Insulin but any other areas you are getting drugs for may be on here and saving money on those Can help pay for other items!

You can also look into 340b programs: https://cheapinsulin.org has information on there for 340b programs and other ways to save on medications.

Can't recall the model numbers or the year. I think the last one I used was the 670.

I absolutely love being tubeless, however I don't like the fact that I need a separate device to control the pump. With Minimed and tslim I got so used to having the control all in one unit but you have to disconnect for showers, swimming,hot tub. The tslim x2 is pretty compact though.
I've been waiting for the Omni 5 compatibility with the Dexcom G7 but according to the company it could take another year. So I've been considering going back to the tslim once they get compatibility w/the G7 since it'll be sooner.  BUT now there is a new option - BetaBionics iLet insulin pump compatible with Dexcom G6. It's a tubed pump with automatic insulin dosing. You only enter your body weight, no basal or bolus rates, no corrections, no carb counting. Sounds scary I know but according to the results of the clinical trials the algorithm is really fast in learning the user's insulin needs. You charge it with a Qi charger and it uses an infusion set. Technically it's waterproof so you may be able to keep wearing it in water. I'm pretty sure the app is available for both iPhone and Android.  I've decided to try the iLet pump once I know if my insurance will cover it. 
Let me know if you want any more info about my experiences with closed loop."

What do you guys like or dislike and why?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14o2j8g/comparing_closed_loop_systems/,"Also, I've always had good to great A1c results with a closed loop system.  With the Omni 5 and Dexcom G6 my last A1c was 6.1. It seems like each time I switch to a new one, my control gets better but it could be due to my greater attn to detail with the new system. I would give most of the credit to the Dexcom CGM. When I switched from Minimed to Tslim my A1c improved quite a bit. Minimed uses their own CGM and now has the Minimed 780 pump and Guardian 4 CGM.   It's being touted as very accurate. 
One other thing to consider is the closed loop system's blood glucose target. I believe both the Tslim and Minimed now allow you to set it as low as 100, whereas the Omni 5 is set at 110."

But I love it. My numbers have been great. Minimed also offers some significant financial assistance that the other companies don’t offer, which was a big help. I’m not poor by any means but this shit gets expensive so any little bit helps."

The 780 with the G4 sensor have some awesome features that I believe Dexcom has already, but it’s great to get those on the Minimed system. Auto corrections, not having to calibrate every 12 hours, and not getting kicked out of auto mode for min/max delivery has been great. 

I’m also using the Minimed 7 day infusion site, which has been great so far. I had some skin irritation after removing it for the first 7 days, but I moved it to a spot I haven’t put sites in before and it’s been great ever since. Not having to change it every 3 days has been a god send."

Trouble Keeping Blood Sugar Down,"(Hope the formatting is okay- I usually post from my phone)

Hi everyone, I've had a rough 24 hours. I have not been able to keep my blood sugar down within my usual range for the life of me. The last 24 hours, my numbers have mostly stayed 170+, which is quite unusual for me. Correction doses seem to have little to no effect. When I finally do correct enough, it stays down for a bit before rising again. See pics for details. This morning, I woke up to 160 and it has risen to 208 now without me eating. Any ideas or insight as to what could be behind this? Thanks in advance.

With all three positive if you’re not strictly a T1 then you’d sooner extremely likely be a LADA than a T2 at any rate. (Which I doubt, you sound like a T1D based on current info) However, pretty much all T1’s go through a phase called the honeymoon phase. Your pancreas isn’t quite dead yet and it rather randomly still produces insulin, fighting the good fight. This can take weeks to months, but the end story is the same: it ends up dead (or well, the beta cells do). With LADA, this process is the same but it takes *a lot* longer. So you may do good on T2 meds first as a LADA; however, even T1’s in honeymoon can do alright on oral meds only for a while so that doesn’t say anything at all and your doctor should know better. 

Anyway, looking at the onset of your symptoms and requiring insulin from the get go: I’d classify you a T1D sooner than a LADA, but remotely diagnosing is impossible - hence the suggestion to try and get an answer from someone who isn’t challenged by a lack of knowledge on the subject; to put it mildly. Does your labwork show a c-peptide test anywhere by any chance? If so, what was the scale and what was the result?"

Autoantibody tests can confirm if you’re T1 and family care doctors don’t know heck about type 1. Your tests will show what you are and a doctors personal opinion doesn’t change that. Which is why an Endo should be able to confirm what type you are which really matters because treatments differ between types.

Your development of symptoms and the progression strongly suggests T1D and currently in a honeymoon phase. Considering proper treatment is very important, I’d really try to get to a proper endocrinologist so you can get a clear and well-substantiated diagnoses of what type you are. The comment “you do well on metmorfin + insulin so you can’t be a T1” is a joke… Even if it turns out to be T2, that’s still a ridiculous thing to say and would be sheer luck they guessed the type right."

In my state you can immediately get a decision on medicaid - we just did for my brother, he turned 26 on the 28th and Friday was the last day of his insurance (should go through the last day of the month you turn 26 - I'm assuming that's your issue now too). It took 3-4 days to get his approval, choose his policy, and get his insurance card, but it all went pretty quickly. Each state handles things differently, but you should be able to apply using a similar process. 

Getting in to see an endo will be the bigger challenge. Under most insurance plans, you will need a referral from one of their doctors, and then waits can be long (typically 1-3 months). If you can stick with your current insurance company, this may streamline the process, but unfortunately, we don't have enough doctors and specialists to get the level of care we should. 

If you must wait on approval, start researching the insurance options you have to choose from. Try to find a doctor who will accept the insurance plan you will go with and see if you can book an appointment. You can explain your situation to the receptionist and see if they can book you for cash payment and switch it to your insurance if you can get everything set up in time (completed sign-up, required referrals, etc). 

As long as you are on insulin and able to keep blood sugars under reasonable control, you should be fine. Many T1s are sent home from the hospital, taking just enough insulin to keep them out of the hospital, and can wait months to see an endo today. Being high for a while won't cause significant damage, as long as you can get the care you need reasonably soon. Unfortunately, doctors are not great with adult diagnoses, so patients often don't get an ideal level of care.

When you see your new primary care doctor (even if you stick with the same insurance I would recommend using the opportunity to change physicians) take copies of your antibody test results, c-peptide tests, and other results to show them. Yes, its in your chart, but your doctor only has minutes to look at it, and your current doctor's notes are likely to make them expect T2. Have the proof on hand to show them you are T1 (or possibly T1.5 - though your diagnosis sounds much more like T1).

I hope that your insurance comes through quickly (even 1 day without insurance is too long as a diabetic, especially a newer one without years of experience and backups of all supplies) and that you can get the care you need soon. Good luck"

Dramatic 30x increase in ISF/CF caused very severe lows - ideas?,"
My 6 yo kiddo’s CF was 100 with MDI, that was changed to 120 when we put him on the op5 last week.

First day or two with the pump was fine but at some point it seems like his insulin sensitivity factor (correction factor) inexplicably increased a whopping 25-30x.

2-3 days back he had a severe stubborn crash from 250 to 45 even though we started treating him at 90. He did turn around eventually but it took a hell lot of carbs. The dose we had given him was only 0.2 units…

After we recovered, we saw that 0.05 units was causing a drop in BG of 100-150 points. Very erratic reaction to insulin dosing, but spike after carbs was typical.

Yesterday, he needed more insulin and seemed that his CF was a little lower. Today, few hours back though, CF has dropped back to near normal levels. Now 1 unit is bringing it down by 100-150 points.

Has anybody seen the ISF change so drastically and suddenly before?

Some observations:
1. This started around the time we went to the pump from MDI. 
2. We use Lily brand lispro in a vial in the pump instead of the kids humalog with the kwikpen. 
3. He did have a whole body allergic rash around the same time we went to the pump. A similar rash has happened a month ago too though when we were on MDI but his CF hadn’t changed this much back then.
4. No changes in his diet or activity level.
5. It could be honeymoon phase but weird that it would start/stop so suddenly and dramatically 2-3 months into diagnosis.

My suspicion is - could his body be having  a hyper sensitive reaction to insulin during those past couple days, perhaps related to the allergic rash? Or was the rash unrelated?

I’m worried his CF may dramatically increase again in future unexpectedly and cause him to have a severe low again. So would like to get to the bottom of this if any ideas.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nr9v6/dramatic_30x_increase_in_isfcf_caused_very_severe/,"You need much less insulin with a pump compared to MDI. But you can also dose smaller doses with it. So, I would work with a reduced correction factor and higher target goal for now.

Especially with children unfortunately there is a lot variety in insulin needs, also connected to all the growing hormones doing their work. With a pump and a CGM it is easier to observe and react accordingly. Also I recommend to be a bit more careful with BG corrections from a higher level, the CGM can be pretty inaccurate in that area. 

Remission phase can also play a role, it can happen a few months after diagnosis."
Dramatic 30x increase in ISF/CF caused very severe lows - ideas?,"
My 6 yo kiddo’s CF was 100 with MDI, that was changed to 120 when we put him on the op5 last week.

First day or two with the pump was fine but at some point it seems like his insulin sensitivity factor (correction factor) inexplicably increased a whopping 25-30x.

2-3 days back he had a severe stubborn crash from 250 to 45 even though we started treating him at 90. He did turn around eventually but it took a hell lot of carbs. The dose we had given him was only 0.2 units…

After we recovered, we saw that 0.05 units was causing a drop in BG of 100-150 points. Very erratic reaction to insulin dosing, but spike after carbs was typical.

Yesterday, he needed more insulin and seemed that his CF was a little lower. Today, few hours back though, CF has dropped back to near normal levels. Now 1 unit is bringing it down by 100-150 points.

Has anybody seen the ISF change so drastically and suddenly before?

Some observations:
1. This started around the time we went to the pump from MDI. 
2. We use Lily brand lispro in a vial in the pump instead of the kids humalog with the kwikpen. 
3. He did have a whole body allergic rash around the same time we went to the pump. A similar rash has happened a month ago too though when we were on MDI but his CF hadn’t changed this much back then.
4. No changes in his diet or activity level.
5. It could be honeymoon phase but weird that it would start/stop so suddenly and dramatically 2-3 months into diagnosis.

My suspicion is - could his body be having  a hyper sensitive reaction to insulin during those past couple days, perhaps related to the allergic rash? Or was the rash unrelated?

a couple of questions as a newly diagnosed t1,"Hello everyone!! 
A couple of questions
I believe I might be going through a bit of a honeymoon phase but Im not sure. The past few days I’ve been 100% in range, and since I started the dexcom it’s been around 85% in range with a couple of small highs here and there (never above 13) is that normal? I haven’t had a single low yet and I’ve been diagnosed since 27th may, despite me being very careless with my dosing sometimes.
For example the other day I injected 5 units of my rapid insulin, and then did not eat anything. (I know this is a bad idea I just wanted to see what happens) My levels were sitting around 8 or 9 before I did that, and barely came down afterwards, maybe sitting at about 6 like 3 hours later.
Sometime I just feel like I don’t even have t1d and they just messed up the tests or something. But I’ve confirmed with all my doctors, I definitely have the antibodies for t1d. Am I in denial? I don’t know. 
I also wanted to know if anybody struggles with an eating disorder on top of all of this? I struggled for YEARS with binge eating, purging, restricting but finally had gotten it all under control, and had a somewhat healthy relationship with food and my body, and the other day I had a proper appointment with a dietician who really went into depth into carb counting and gave me set amounts and I have fallen off the deep end. To be honest, I don’t know what to do. I’m struggling with everything so much and i guess nobody around me really understands the severity of it.

There's multiple levels of functioning, as well as an entire spectrum to put yourself into. Visit the r/autism subreddit and see if you fit in there.

It's very common for autistic folks to go undiagnosed for years or even decades. You shouldn't be ashamed of an autism diagnosis, you should take it all in and say to yourself ""so this is why I do XYZ!"" Keep it from others if you can because of the complete misunderstanding general society has for autism.

There's millions of autistic folks that get through life every day, hiding their true selves from society. Some have chosen to unmask and just be themselves. It's controversial, but improves mental health.

Being ""halfway bipolar"" is part of autism. Debilitating ADHD is often a part of autism. Frequent overload and breakdowns are a key symptom of autism. Mood swings in response to excessive stress are a part of autism.

You get the idea.

The WHO has recently declared autism to be a self-diagnosable condition, so again, I'd encourage you to head over to r/autism and see if you fit in. A formal diagnosis can give you a few extra legal protections for certain situations."

Does diabetes cause you to overeat?,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14nf9kl/does_diabetes_cause_you_to_overeat/,There is a blood test and it can be addressed with hormone replacement. I discovered it accidentally in myself when I gained about 30 lbs after diagnosis and my doctor suggested we try a glp-1 agonist since I'm still making a small amount of insulin and it's a common pairing in Europe for Lada patients. Most people have talked about no longer having food noise on these meds and I suddenly have normal hunger cues again. After speaking to my Endo we suspect the issue was an Amylin deficiency - which we can't test for now but is a normal part of diabetic - since Amylin is also produced in the pancreas. Some of us are just impacted more than others I've learned.

Many years ago when I was in my 20's I travelled to Thailand with some friends. I had done so much research on a ""waterproof case"" for the pump I had (Medtronic 520 or something at the time?). I remember going to pool parties, having the time of my life with my buddies for a few nights. And then at one party this literal child came up to me and said ""You're beeping!"" after I jumped out of a massive pool party with probably hundreds of people at it.

Maybe just an alarm or something? Nope. Fatal error. Water damage. Pump never worked again. Had already had it for 5+ years so no warranty. Luckily I had brought a travel backup pump from Medtronic (Free to do, by the way, but has to be returned within 90 days). I used the backup for the rest of the trip and when I got home and told my story to a bunch of friends and family they decided to GoFundMe a new one and sent it to everyone I knew. Raised like $5500 within 24hrs. New pump was around $7500 at the time. Insane and will never forget people's generosity for my own problems.

It was an expensive $2000 lesson but, could have been a lot worse. Don't trust Waterproof cases."

This pump has changed my life y’all. I was so resistant for years (more resistant than the pump, apparently), and finally gave in, wishing I had done so sooner. The thought of being without was devastating. How privileged I am to have it is not lost on me. Money should not be a barrier to optimum health!

I quickly dried it off and frantically googled, hoping for good news. According to the Tandem website, the pump is water resistant up to 3 feet/30 minutes. I was about 1/3 of the time and the depth (small celebration). I then found several people who apparently do all types of water sports in them and never have issues! *relief*

That is why insurance restricts us from getting a new pump for 4 yrs. Pretty much all accidental damage is covered. I think it is pretty unusual for them not to replace since they get so much $$ for buying the supplies. Just think of all the things young kids probably do to these pumps.

However at some point in our life’s there will be a trigger such as an illness or huge emotion stress that kick starts those autoimmune cells into life.

I have sorta a similar situation. My doctors are still unsure what type I have.  At the moment, I am just a pre-diabetic.

I never had an issue with blood sugar until after I was administered the C Vaccine. After the V, I became very sick and noticed frequent urination, thirst, and weird blurred vision.  I get blood work down often and noticed my fasting glucose was increasing every few months. Normally, my fasting blood sugars are in the 50-70s with no symptoms of hypoglycemia. Now, they are in the predibetic range and increasing despite fasting, no carbs, and exercise. My labs are showing a decrease in insulin production and an increase in A1c. I think I have LADA or Type 1.5. My endo doesn't want to say I am type II, because I am very thin, athletic, and eat very well.  He doesn't want to say I am type1 either, because I am producing just enough insulin for him to say it is not type 1.

I am just stuck in between.

I know this all started with the V, so I believe yours could have started with COVID.

Oh! Just remembered! A woman at my job was diagnosed with type 1.5 after being sick with COVID. He also told me he is seeing an increase in people with diabetes and autoimmune diseases. After the V, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. It was all triggered by the V and probably COVID."

I’m getting better at reading the dots, but there’s definitely more trending information on the guardian than dexcom so far.  

OTOH the actually important alerts and ability to get info on my watch are fantastic.  There’s less noise and CONSTANT buzzing from the dexcom."
Clinical Trials,"Hello all,

I am reaching out to the community to inquire about clinical trials. 

I know very little about the process of what's involved. I'm wondering what information anyone might have regarding alternative treatments to Type 1 Diabetes. 

Also, does anyone have information about Type 1 in other countries and perhaps what alternative treatments they might be using to manage? 

I've lived with Type 1 since 1993. I'm 38 years old and live in California. I AM SO TIRED OF NEEDLES. I am so tired of the pain. I struggle with retinopathy as a complication among other nerve issues. 

To be fair, I'm reasonably healthy and could certainly have caused myself more issues had I not come to my senses later in life. 

I've just had this disease for so fucking long and it's wearing me out. Any sort of ideas, questions, or comments would help me greatly. 

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14naco9/clinical_trials/,"Check clinicaltrials.gov. Every trial in the country is posted there, along with sites that are participating. 

For trials, you really want Phase 3 or 4. Phase 1 and 2 are very early in the process, and there’s not much (or even any) to suggest it works. They’re looking mostly at safety at that point.

Also, what do you mean by “alternative treatments”? There is one and only one treatment for T1D: Insulin. There are other medications that can help under some circumstances, but no insulin replacement."

Favorite infusion set?,"Fellow pump users, I’m looking to change what infusion set I use. I’ve been using the TruSteel sets since I got my pump early 2021 and I’m unhappy with them now.

Steel needles are in general just way more reliable for me. 

I’ve used every inset that Tandem offers, the Omnipods, most of the Medtronic versions and Animas as well. 

Occasionally I’ll have a run where it hurts or bleeds/bruises but the actual sites themselves almost never fail. 

My preference overall is any inset that doesn’t have an inserter like the Tandem VariSoft or Medtronic Silhouette. I have a harder time maintaining 90° insertion angle sites other than the Medtronic Quickset."

It was amazing barely had to take insulin, i'm not over weight and never had been but I did lose 10lbs on it. Here's the downside... After two years (some people it takes longer) my body started rejecting it. It put me in the hospital 3x because I couldn't stop profusely vomiting for days. From what my dr told me they are starting to see this a lot with people on Ozempic not to mention muscle weakness. I switched to Trulicity and haven't had any issues with the same benefits. Please keep in mind once you start these types of meds you can't just stop. If you so you will need 3x as much insulin as you needed before (from experience). Good luck to you!"

Sliding scale diabetes management whilst in hospital,I’m type 1 diabetic. In hospital for spine surgery. Had first surgery on Tuesday & they let me manage my own injections. I felt good. But now I need a second surgery & they put me on an insulin/glucose sliding scale in an iv drip. It’s keeping my blood glucose in the 6’s and 7’s. (Don’t know how that equates to USA readings). But I feel awful on it. Being constantly given glucose then insulin depending on my hourly blood glucose reading. Has anyone had experience of this? Thank you,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14mc4sx/sliding_scale_diabetes_management_whilst_in/,"I would say bring it up with your doctor honestly. As I understand it, when you are going to have surgery, having a high will increase your risk of a infection, prolonged stays in the hospital, and potentially even death. The intent of Sliding Scale, or VRIII(Variable Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion) as it's ""officially"" called, is to minimize the likelihood of any potential chance of high BG when a patient is in a situation where their BG numbers will be unusually variable, like a diabetic hospital patient needing to minimize eating before a surgery. The amount of fluids in your body can also have an impact on the surgery and how your body handles it, so it isn't just glucose being given but also other ""body maintenance fluids"" so that when you go to the operating table, you 100% without any question aren't dehydrated or lacking in any specific thing your body needs like potassium.

Though I just want to double check, but you do genuinely mean the 6-7 range, and not 16-17 correct? In mg/dl, that's about the 110-126 range, which is within the recommended range for type 1s if a bit on the upper end, being 4.5-7.2. The target range for Sliding Scale is actually 6-10 though, meaning you are within the ideal target range, if a bit on the lower side. Unless you are meaning that it isn't ""feeling too high/low"" that's bothering you, but the roller coaster of rising and falling constantly due to the IV? I know how a rapid rise and fall can hit you like a truck, so if you're rather sensitive to that sensation, I'd imagine it must feel terrible. 

Like I said, I'd genuinely bring up how you are feeling with your doctor. If it's what I mentioned before, that the IV is repeatedly over-correcting highs, then over-correcting lows and repeating, that's a sign the system isn't being used properly. If that isn't the reason you feel bad, well you still feel bad which means *somethings* going on. I'd try to get some time to speak with the doctor, or head nurse, or whoever's in charge of your stay and let them know that you are feeling unwell, with it possibly being due to the VRIII. I'd make sure to ask about *why* they have you on VRIII so that if they are receptive and are willing to genuinely listen to you, you can work out some sort of change to the system like how much it will deliver, or maybe even go back to personal management. 

There's likely some sort of form you could request that lets you go back to personal management, with the note that if anything bad does happen, you signing the form means you can't blame the hospital for it. If you feel confident enough that you can genuinely manage your own sugars to the requirements the hospital wants you to be in pre-surgery, that's an option to ask about.

Though ultimately I'm just some dude online, so take my advice with a bucket of salt. The best solution for almost any problem involving other people is communication. Let the people watching over you know how you are feeling, let them know what you are worried about, and try to work with them to find an outcome that is ideal for both you and them."
Sliding scale diabetes management whilst in hospital,I’m type 1 diabetic. In hospital for spine surgery. Had first surgery on Tuesday & they let me manage my own injections. I felt good. But now I need a second surgery & they put me on an insulin/glucose sliding scale in an iv drip. It’s keeping my blood glucose in the 6’s and 7’s. (Don’t know how that equates to USA readings). But I feel awful on it. Being constantly given glucose then insulin depending on my hourly blood glucose reading. Has anyone had experience of this? Thank you,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14mc4sx/sliding_scale_diabetes_management_whilst_in/,I think it is a common practice in hospitals. As far as I know as long as you are able they also let you manage your glucose levels by yourself. Would you feel more comfortable like that?

But it does feel like I’m going from high to low over & over. It’s 125 ml/hr of 4% glucose & 2 ml/hr of insulin. Latest blood glucose 4.5 so they just adjusted it to 1 ml/hr insulin. So now I get to zoom up again. It’s been 4 hrs and the operation keeps being delayed. I moaned about feeling lousy and they said it’s just till after the operation so there is hopefully an end in sight!

Here in Sweden it is either 4-10 or 4-9.something (I forget exactly). When I was diagnosed in the UK it was 4-9.

Also being in that range isn't everything. If it is isn't level, more going up and down, due to the adding insulin and then correcting with glucose, it can make you feel quite exhausted.

Unfortunately I doubt they will do much about it. With such a serious surgery as spinal they will probably prioritise healing over how the patient feels."

They initially said they would be back to check it in an hour and I raged and said you will stop this immediately and treat me with glucose. I could have a comma if you leave me for an hour still on the bloody machine with and extreme hypo! So they did half an hour later after doctors approval and me feeling like I was dying. But then they turned it on again when I’d gone back up to 9.6. Thankfully the surgeon popped in whilst I was recovering from the low to say surgery has it’s been postponed till tomorrow due to an emergency case and they will reassess me at 6am. So now I’m having tea and toast. Have to go nill by mouth again  at 2 am

Canadian programs for insulin costs?,"Hi all! I’ve been a type 1 diabetic for like 4 ish years now, I’m 26, and I just lost my job, aka my benefits. 

Do you know of any government programs (or any other things too) that pay for insulin / arm sensors? 

I’m located in southern Ontario (in Canada) so currently ADP covers most of my omnipod costs so I’m not worried about that, it’s my Freestyle Libre 2 & my novorapid insulin vials that are expensive and have no coverage now. I’ve never had to pay for supplies at full cost before and I can’t afford it bc EI pays nothing and i still don’t have a new job yet. also I’m not covered by OHIP anymore because I’m over 25. 

If you know of any programs or whatever please let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14msujg/canadian_programs_for_insulin_costs/,"The Trillium drug program is based on your income and covers the Libre as well as biosimilar insulins to brand name ones. Novorapid won't be covered, but biosimilar insulin aspart is.

You will pay 4% of your income as a deductible, then after that, no more than $2 ""per drug"" but I'm not sure if they'll base if off your past income or current.

You may be able to purchase at shoppers and stack with PC Optimum points using the app on any portion unpaid. I'm not sure if it's allowed for prescriptions, but it is if you buy over the counter. I used to buy Libre over the counter on 20x bonus point days (which is 30% back in points) and then once I had accumulated 200 000 pc points ($200 worth) I'd wait for a redemption deal where I get $300 off my purchase when redeeming 200k points. Insulin and syringes can be bought this way as well. This is more of a long haul game but might as well start earning the points just in case. You can buy other stuff at shoppers to increase your point earnings. 3 Libres and 4 packs of insulin pens should get to close to 200k points for example, and then you'll essentially be able to able to get 2 libres and a pack of insulin free. I use pens so I'm not sure how much vials cost but theyll probably be cheaper. Libres are $120 at shoppers but you get the points to use later. Check my post history for a breakdown. 

Costco also has cheaper Libres I've read (80 to 90$).

Hope this will help tie you over until you get approved for the program/get a new job with benefits."

I’m gonna cry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14mim40/please_give_advice_on_staying_in_target_range/,"Sorry to hear you’re having a rough night! I’ve been there and days like that are no fun. There’s some good advice but I think the biggest thing is honestly just figuring out your body and what works best for you. 

Do some basal testing. Make sure your overnight basal is correct. When my a1c was in the mid 7s I was frusturated because my daytime numbers were awesome. So much of our day is subsequently overnight so if time in range isn’t there overnight it’s not going to matter as much how your blood sugar is during the day. Your a1c will be higher if your night numbers are higher. 

If you have a cgm great! If not, highly recommend. My cgm has allowed me to take my a1c from the 7s to the low to mid 5s. Mainly because I’ve been able to really figure out how food affects me. Chocolate crossiants? Love them. Before I’d spike to 300 and come crashing down. Now because I know how I react to them I can usually peak at 180 and land smoothly. It’s really valuable. Also- it taught me I really over treat lows. I found most of the time I need 4-8 grams of carbs. Occasionally I need 15-20 but unless I’m aggressively dropping, I start more moderate and see where I’m at in 15.

Prebolusing really is your best friend. With a cgm you can figure out what timing works best for you. 

Lastly the biggest tool I use is movement. My diabetes is actually a lot more predictable if I commit to some daily movement. I like working out but not everyday. I’ve basically committed to myself at least a half hour walk a day. It’s good for me and it helps keep me sensitive so I don’t worry about low carb."

(Butternut squash and sweet potato some people include I know among others) but the thing I’m not getting is how many carbs is low carb? Do you mind sharing how many g of carb you roughly eat a day? And if you’re eating low carb, do you bolus for protein and fat? If I’m eating something with 15-20g of protein, and 15g of carbs, I can’t just bolus for the carbs. My blood sugar will be high. I find that I have to bolus for the protein too so if I’m bolusing for carbs AND protein and maybe even fat, the blouses will be a lot of insulin. My ratio is 1:6. I’ve seen some people on here comment that a steak and veggies will only be 1 unit of insulin to cover their meal which to me literally makes no sense being that a 6oz steak has about 40g of protein and fat content that your body will turn into glucose. Do you mind sharing how many minutes before a meal you bolus, and if and how you bolus for the fat and protein? I’m taking humalog now and I know it’s very fast acting, so timing matters because fat and protein digest slower and peak later in the blood than carbs do. So that’s also throwing me off. And maybe if you don’t mind sharing some sample meals of what you eat in a day? I always read the back labels on foods and check the carbs fats and proteins. Because if you’re low carb you need higher fat and protein for sustenance. I apologize I’m sure you’re very busy this is just confusing as heck. I’m at a loss here.

For example, someone eats 60g of carb a day so 20g at every meal, they need to up their protein and fat. Confusing part is, do they just bolus for the 20g of carbs not the fat and protein? If the meal is high protein let’s say 30g and maybe 15g of fat, I’d think more than likely you need to bolus for them because your body will turn them into sugar/energy. That means you end up taking a lot of insulin for the 3 macros. Or, the other side, don’t fill up on leafy greens and veg and low glycemic berries like black berries, which are around 6g of carb, and then bolus for the protein and fat only. Which will result in less insulin used. It’s just all very confusing I don’t know how to approach this diet/lifestyle. 😔"

when annual enrollment comes around compare plans with their deductible, max out of pocket and copays/coinsurance. i switched to a plan with a slightly higher premium (through the marketplace so my actual payment wasn’t that much more) because now i have a $0 deductible. if you haven’t met your deductible yet then you pay the contracted amount which can be higher than the amount with no insurance."

I was diagnosed almost a year ago and still have no idea how to play the insurance game. I have BCBS. Does anyone have any tips that could help me bring down my co-pay? Possibly preferred pharmacy? I saw something about a Tier exception form?

 Im currently trying to get on the omnipod 5 and dexcom g6, and the estimated quotes I've gotten are more with insurance than without. As you can see, this has only confused me more. How does with insurance cost MORE? 

TLDR: No clue how insurance works, what do I do to pay less?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14m5qaj/how_to_pay_less_with_insurance/,"Ask your doctor. They’ll know what to do. Your insurance company has it classified as either DME or pharmacy, but the only way to know is to run it through insurance. 

Alternatively, Insulet and Dexcom can help. They helped me navigate insurance coverage when I started."

Post meal rise,Hi everyone.  So something new that looks to be happening to my 8yo t1d son is a significant rise starting an hour or hour and a half after the meal.  He ate at 12 today with a 10 min prebolus.  Looks like it was going great and then the rise happened.  Happens with every meal.  This has never happened before unless he had some really fatty like pizza or French fries.  It's the same lunch he's been eating for a long time now.  Any thoughts?  Thanks!,https://i.redd.it/yginhua4109b1.jpg,"Use an extended bolus and spread the insulin delivery out over a longer time.  Start with say, 50% up front and the other 50% over the next hour.  Adjust the ratio as necessary.


Also, you might want to change that high glucose alarm to a lower value so you can take action to correct it sooner."

Thanks!,https://i.redd.it/yginhua4109b1.jpg,"How long has your son been diagnosed? And what kind of insulin are you using? 

I think for most kids on humalong / novalog, a 10 minute pre bolus is not nearly enough, I generally would like to see a drop off at dose time and then a quick rise. the lack of a significant drop on this graph at 12 noon indicates that perhaps the pre bolus isn't long enough.

If your son was recently diagnosed, the issue could be that honeymoon is ending and you need to adjust to post honeymoon diabetes.

How old is the pod? We typically see less responsive insulin on day 3 (and on a new pod) vs a pod that is 6-60 hours in use.

Do you have a graph for the basal? With Loop (Omnipod but not o5) we run into this issue a lot when basal gets suspended for more than an hour. 

What was the lunch? are you sure your timings are accurate? I think it's pretty odd that a 8 year old eating at 12 noon would have a BG that is trending down until 1 p.m. That could make O5 ""think"" the lunch bolus was ""too strong"" and cause it to turn off he basal.

Even if the lunch was not pizza, that trendline is indicative of a higher fat meal which is digesting slowly. It could also be the the dexcom is giving less than accurate reading (maybe the transmitter is close to 90 days)? 

In general, meals should spike to 140-160 (even with O5) post eating (like 15-30 minutes after commencing eating), unless they are super low carb. If the meal doesn't spike it generally indicates the meal bolus is too strong (or there is an issue with the dexcom)"

Can't really do that while he's at school in August tho so I hope things go back to somewhat normal by then.

As far as alarm, I'm aware of his bg pretty much all the time unless I'm sleeping.   He went up to 220 before I did a small bolus and he's coming back down now.  It's so strange, like he started digesting carbs a lot slower or something."

Weird, like once the bolus happened, the basal just wasn't being absorbed or something.  Still have the evening high a couple hours after dinner...but that's been happening off and on since diagnosis.  Probably hormones and/or fatty meals some days.  

Thanks for the response!  This new pod has been so much better, I should really get into the habit of changing it out sooner if these things happen to at least rule it out.  Hate wasting insulin like that though."

It happens.  I can eat the same food with the same bolus and it comes out perfect, but there's always that one time where it sends my numbers into orbit and I can't figure out why.  


I don't know if you have seen it yet, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qd0gLQ6W98) on youtube absolutely nails it.  It's pretty funny because it's all true."

Also some people get accustomed to certain insulins - my daughter started having lots of weird readings on Humalog so we switched to Novolog and are day 3 issues when away. But now we are on FIASP and the day 3 issues are back (even though FIASP is just Novolog + b3 vitamins!)

That flat line for a meal is pretty impressive, what are you doing food wise? 

On the post dinner rise, I don't know why this isn't better known, but BG / insulin needs are totally age dependent and for kids, there is a marked increase in insulin needs post bedtime thru the early morning hours. 

[https://diatribe.org/rules-engagement-basal-insulin-adjustment-or-avoiding-basal-blunders](https://diatribe.org/rules-engagement-basal-insulin-adjustment-or-avoiding-basal-blunders)

Dawn phenomenon is predominantly an adult issue.  My daughter goes from needing around .8-.9 units during the day to needing 1.4 units or more between 9 and midnight. (she's 9). So the evening high after dinner is totally normal, I'm not sure how the 05 algo handles kids, but I suppose you could cheat it a little and enter some phantom carbs at bedtime. But larger issue is, that rise is totally to be expected with an 8 year old, annoying that the omnipod5 doesn't handle it."

I think this gets back to O5 borrowing future basal to pay for bolus now. Like if you bolus 5 units and your basal rate is 1 unit per hour, O5 might bolus 5 or a bit more and then suspend / cut basal to keep you in range and adjust basal as needed.

There's also a good amount of fat in the PB + milk and chips which probably slows the digestion down.

Also, at the pre bolus, what's the typical BG? having a higher BG at pre bolus also helps with automated systems as the system is more willing to give a larger bolus if it thinks you are unlikely to be out of range soon (one of the ""downsides"" with Loop is it is very easy to sit in the 80-low 90s which makes bolusing hard)."

Ask your endo to write the script for changing the pod every 2 days - mine suggested this to me so I think it's pretty well known in the endo world that pods don't always last 3 days. Also nice to have extra pods.

I still like to pull the 80 hour pod now and then, but when in doubt, change the pod.

You might want to see if they have an extra vial of humalog to see if that performs better on day 3 (most insurance you can pay a bit extra for the nonapproved insulin, I think for us it's 120 vs 90 for a 3 month supply and for kids we only need to refill 2x a year so and extra 60 bucks for day 3 pod usage was worth it).

what kind of a1c are you getting on Omnipod5? that graph looks great for a ""problem day"" lol"

Why is my FreeStyle Libre 2 so inaccurate?,I don’t understand why there is such a big discrepancy in the readings from my Libre and my meter. It kept telling me I was low last night and I ended up waking up this morning at nearly 300. Anyone have any idea if this is a faulty Libre or what is going on? I haven’t been to impressed with this system to be honest.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14madza,"Option 1: You got a dodgy sensor. Call Abbott, tell them it’s not reading anywhere close to fingersticks (cite an example- it’s telling me I’m 65 and fingerstick says 180 etc) and ask for a replacement sensor.

Option 2: Is it your first day wearing the Libre? Cos the first day for me is always a bit wonky. It’ll either read low all night or high all night with no in between. (You can “pre-soak” a sensor by putting it on but not activating it 24 hours before your previous one dies. I don’t do this because I enjoy my few hours not being a cyborg, but it’s certainly an option)

Option 3: Those low alarms at night- are you laying on the sensor? Libre 2 suffers compression lows- if you lay on the sensor, the sensor can’t read interstitial fluid properly because there isn’t enough so it just shrieks at you and tells you that you are low."

Hell, I’m T1D because I have lupus.. don’t ya just love it when you say you’re going broke buying insulin and the first thing you hear is “but they locked the price at like $35!!” - like, no, my dear fucker, they TRIED to and the greedy ass companies went and found a work around and while it’s less expensive, it’s still stupid expensive for a lot of us and some of us are still literally dying because they can’t afford it..

My advice: try to get Medicaid/Medicare or straight up disability.. if you have a doctor who is really good at creatively writing your letter of medical and you can meet the financial requirements, you’re going to be sitting pretty. I can’t qualify (make too much money some years, but too little the rest, so yay for the struggle bus rollercoaster).. you might want to try to qualify on the lupus being the main factor for disability, with the diabetes as secondary.. but definitely consult a disability lawyer and see why hoops you can jump through. Good luck!"

Not to say that I expect a handout, but for the love of Pete. 

I've been caught in this particular cycle for a long time, it goes like this:

I need insulin. 

I can get insulin two ways. 

1. Work a full time job and hope they provide adequate insurance. 

2. Be at near poverty level and obtain help from social services, which can be extremely challenging in its own right. 

I am at the mercy of the system, we as diabetics are at the mercy of a system. 

It pisses me off. 

Another amazing thing is that we are at the peak of advancement in technology and science. Type 1 diabetics in the past  rarely made it past their 20s! Yet, here we are at the mercy of big pharma, being forced to fit into a role. 

What I'm trying to say is that I get it. I've had diabetes since 1993."

My heart,",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14lgnb1/i_hate_that_i_have_to_choose/,"I have been disabled since 2012 (about 8 autoimmune conditions and a handful of undiagnosed symptoms). The process to get disability is long (6 months - 2+ years, with a small percentage of people qualifying at 6 months), but it is definitely a possibility. Look into medicaid programs or expanded medicaid if your income is too high and your state participates. It is definitely worth applying for disability if your health prevents you from working. I used a disability lawyer, though they do nothing for the initial application. They took 25% of my upfront payment for writing 1 letter saying they represented me. They wouldn't even read over my filing or provide any advice. I was one of the few that is awarded disability on first review (I had a long, well documented medical history and was in bad physical shape at the time), so my lawyer earned a couple thousand dollars for doing nothing. I probably would have been awarded disability on the first application even without the lawyer, though Social Security knew I was committed to fighting for it, so that definitely could have played a role. You can definitely wait to hire a lawyer until after your first denial and potentially save yourself a significant amount of money. If your case is strong enough, a lawyer is not necessary, and if not, you probably would have needed to appeal anyway. The statistics have improved since my application, 38% of qualified applicants are approved on the initial application now (usafacts.org - maybe a reliable source??? I was told more like 5% of applications were approved the first try when I applied - though this number would have included people who clearly didn't qualify).

Medicaid programs, assistance programs through various drug manufacturers, insurance resources (Kaiser Permanente will help cover some costs for low income people in financial need), and various charities can help fill the gap. I had a glucose meter and test strips donated by the ADA (American Diabetes Association) when I lost my insurance about 15 years ago. Talk with your doctors - some have sample supplies they can give you, others can help you access programs offered by insurance or manufacturers. Apply for food stamps. They should be able to use your medical costs (bring receipts if possible) to reduce your income and help you qualify. As at least one other person mentioned, look into food banks near you. Usually, there are no income requirements necessary or applications required to take advantage of these programs. There are a lot of programs to help, but they can be hard to find. 

I hope that you can get some assistance to help you stay healthy and safe and that your health recovers (at least as much as possible)."

That’s the first thing, goes to every type 1 diabetic, join one. It’s a couple quid a month and any flack you get they will be by your side. 

Your workplace legally has to make adjustments to accommodate your diabetes, [(1)Section 20, Equality Act 2010] failing to do so is against the law. What a Reasonable adjustment is up to debate. Typical things for type 1 diabetics is set shifts, set break times, allowed to check blood sugar and take breaks for hypos and hypers. Reasonable adjustments stop when a company can prove you cannot perform your role safely. A company could dismiss you if they feel that they have done everything they can to support you and you are still unable to work effectively. I think the issue with your adjustment is that simply taking days off would be difficult to justify. I’m not a solicitor and have barely any knowledge on this subject. I don’t think seeking legal advice would be worth it here because the adjustment is far fetched and would be a major detriment to the company but obviously like I said I am not a solicitor. 

If you are a member of a trade union, call them. They will give you advice."

I wouldn't quit on the spot, but that sounds like discrimination, especially since T1D is an ""unseen disability"" under the UK Equality Act of 2010.

If you've got a union representative or works council, talk to them, and refresh your resume.

Also, posting anonymously on Glassdoor can warn other people with disabilities.

> Under the Equality Act, employers should not put someone with a disability in a situation where they’re disadvantaged as a result of their disability. For example, if you have to take a short break from a meeting to treat a hypo, you should not have missed out on decisions or opportunities that may affect your work or career.

Overall: crappy handling. Maybe it's a lack of knowledge, maybe malice.
Also, when dealing with that kind of stuff, ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS leave a paper trail. Write them an email recapping your meeting, and do further communication via email, so you have receipts when talking to a union rep or some other person that can help you."

I don't have diabetes but have gone through something similar with a different condition. Personally I wouldn't be able to recover a functional working relationship with someone after this. Once something like this happens, I know I need to make moves to leave because I will start getting snappy and irritable with the person, and over time I start to look like the bad guy to outsiders. Sucks but that's just the professional world.

Personally I won't quit a job without having something else lined up though. Plugging away at the applications keeps my blood pressure under control.

I do wonder if you have a legal recourse here. I would send her an email roughly outlining what was said and end it with something like, ""Please correct me if I am wrong. I will take a lack of response as confirmation that these are in fact your expectations."" Back the email chain up somewhere off company servers. This is probably the closest thing you'll get to written documentation that this is what went down."

In any case, though I'm not familiar with UK laws, you should definitely find out what protections you have for 'disability discrimination', 'serious health condition', 'chronic health condition'.  Your employer should not be able to discriminate against you because of your diabetes or for any serious health condition.  Also, check for protections against retaliation due to your disability - here in the US Diabetes is considered a disability.  And they absolutely should not be 'advising' you about your medical condition.  In the US under the Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA), they'd be in violation of fed law.

I can see both sides of this matter, on the one hand yes everyone has a bad night/no sleep and each person is going to have a different response. Employers cannot be responsible for how well or poorly employees sleep. But if your ability to control your diabetes is impacted then this can definitely rise to the level of medical accommodation.

Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14l7cs3/meeting_with_hr_should_i_leave/,"I don’t think this is the picture the OP painted. A T1D goes low (still not clear on the frequency) overnight and, due to having to care for oneself when normally the OP sleeps, the OP is requesting a reasonable accommodation that would allow for work from home in order to execute self-care and alleviate the ensuing tiredness. 

This is a textbook reason to use an illness day, not a means to have HR provide a work from home scenario. If one is too tired to go to work (for whatever reason), working from home will not solve the issue. How is this solution providing an accommodation that will assist the employee and still allow for the regular workload to be performed in the manner required? 

What the OP is looking for is satisfied by (most) employer-provided illness days. We have to do the work as T1Ds, where assistance is needed to allow us to accommodate the illness, HR will assist with company policy. The OP framing this as an “I’m too tired because I had an extreme low” doesn’t address the root issue—being too tired. Working from home does not alleviate the situation unless we’re talking about gaining a little extra sleep and still putting in an 8-hour (or whatever is called for) day (i.e., come in later and stay later with the same amount of productivity). Was that what you meant OP?"

My T1 friends spent some time with me and just said ""we would not be able to deal with that, what your body does is insanity, you need to be studied"". My i:c goes from 1:3 to 1:15, randomly, without any rhyme and reason. My activity is always same, and my basal is usually fine, but the effect foods have on me is incredibly variable day to day, and even hour to hour. I eat same breakfast every day, after being flat whole night. I usually do 8u - 3 to battle my dawn phenommenon, 5 to cover 25g carbs my breakfast has. two out of three days, this will result is slight up, some 30pts, and back down. But every 3rd day? It's gonna be either a massive low that needs minimum 30g carbs to get back up to normal, or I will need to add extra 5-6 units to stop spiking over 250. Or need 2 extra units, or 3, or 4. I never know how much. And this is variability for every single meal, so in two days, I have at least 1-2 meals that have insane results. I have given up to 1:1 carb ratio before for things, and as little as 1:20. Protein can spike me to high hell, or barely have any effect at all. I also get random spikes out of nowhere some days, where I spike 150pts in 45min. The only reason why I don't stay high super long is cause I bolus at 150-160 and so it goes up to 250 and comes back down, but there is no way to stop these spikes because they are completely random (I hate it the most when it happens during night, cause I don't have alarms so I can't take care of it before it's too high, and then I feel awful). These are less common (like once a week) but nevertheless annoying.   


I have decent control - low-mid 6s a1c and 85% in range, but I am genuinely jealous of people who can just count carbs, adjust their settings, and be fine. I can't - and probably wouldn't be able to even with a pump because of how insanely variable my i:c ratios are. There is no diabetes teams where I live - you get some very very basic education when you are diagnosed IF you are lucky. Maximum length of appointments with endo is 5min, they usher you out. I HAVE to do this on my own, with older tools.  


When I had a weird week where my i:c didn't vary, I got 97% in range overal, with 120 average bg, and 4 out of those 7 days I was 100% in range. And then my body started hating on me again. I got a taste of how good my control would be, if I didn't struggle with randomness so much. Doctors back home in my country told me I am lying, and accused me of bribing nurses because my blood sugars were too weird even in hospital setting - cause it's easier to believe a poor(no money) 12y/o would find money to bribe nurses to bring them candy and then take away wrappers, than that someone would actually have unpredictable body."

We've all had these nights where we've needed to start later and make the time back. The compassion is letting me start later/rescheduling meetings, not skipping work altogether.

If so, seek to get a pump and life will be much easier because you can control both basal and bolus. The lows you describe are dangerous and medical justification for a pump. Blood glucose will rise, as you describe, from one day to the next even if you eat the same meal because of contributors beyond food. When I was faced with meeting tight deadlines, or project deliverables, my blood glucose was always running higher due to stress and anxiety. This rise would continue for days on end as the deadline approached -- you're likely often facing this as a coder. Trying to control this with injections will result in the lows you describe. With a pump, whether you run it manually or via loop, it's possible (after some trial and error learning) to stay in range approaching 100%. I've been there, done that, and you can do it too.

I lived through those years as well, surviving several insulin shock seizures, before home blood glucose testing was available (only urine tests). In my early days, the goal was to keep urine sugar free and to achieve that I followed the Exchange diet system (this was before carb counting). btw, carb counting is only a guide but the root issue is controlling blood glucose. As you correctly describe, blood glucose goes up or down for a variety of reasons even if they're not understood. Once blood glucose test strips were available, I was checking 6-8 times each day and was able to keep A1c in the 6s. My life on injections continued for 39 years until my first pump in 2004 and my first CGM about 6 years ago. While CGM and pump make managing less intense, good A1c (i.e., in the 6s) can be achieved with injections and test strips. My career allowed me to work on three continents. When I met diabetics, the ones having difficulties had issues with making wise food choices even with home prepared meals because most foods are just too rich and compensating with insulin results in the roller-coaster etc., leading to burn-out. If I eat a bowl of potato chips in the evening, my blood glucose will continue to rise throughout the night even though I took the correct insulin based on carbs. The beauty of the pump is the ability to create and manage multiple basal profiles to approximately mimic the pancreas. With injections, I always planned a day in advance what the morning injections would be based on physical activity or pending stress. With the pump, advance planning is not required. That is the core difference between the old and new tech i.e., the advanced planning required.

Your A1c in the 6s and 85% in range is excellent. I expect your numbers are better than anything I could have done at your age. There is no reason for you to be ""...jealous of people who can just count carbs..."" because as you correctly describe, it's not quite that simple. I take myself into account at the end of each day, and if I not satisfied with what I done, I try to do better the next day. Comparison (to others) is the thief of Joy.

btw, because this thread had comments about ""fragile"" and ""brittle"" diabetes here is a review [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32620472/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32620472/)

I was 400 last night at some point and im still here on time"" 

I'm normally all about anti-capitalism but in this case I believe it's really just coming to terms with reality. Asking for a blanket pass to skip work because of diabetes is the exact same as a father saying they are tired and need to skip work because their kid kept them up all night. 

The world sucks, all of us here were dealt a crappy hand in life but you also have to understand that it's no one's job to take care of you other than yourself. The fact that OP is in the UK is even funnier to me because at least they have socialized medicine to make it so they aren't forced to work at certain jobs for health benefits to stay alive like we have to in the USA. 

Another factor to consider is if you ask for a ton of accommodations is that you will most likely never get promoted. Is that fair? No, not at all. But again, the world sucks, the corporate world even more so and they will definitely overlook you for promotions if you are seen as the ""flaky medical issues guy"""

It's up to the individual to manage how they handle those outside factors, and whether or not chronic disability is a reason to take a sick day. but if this is the way  you're framing it then yes, they absolutely can say no to your request. It's like asking for special accomodations for having a sick kid, all the time. There's a lot that you can't control about having a sick kid but as the caretaker you're the responsible party that needs to take a sick day, no special accommodations. In the US, if your disability is that much of an issue, you would likely have to file short term disability in order to take more sick days than the employer provides. The best you can do is disclose your disability so that the company can't retaliate for taking sick days."

Most employers will not find it ""reasonable"" to have unlimited time off without ample warning, which is why it isn't illegal to have a limited number of sick days to begin with.

Your employer shouldn't have made comments about your health, but you would have to consult a lawyer to see if anything they did was, legally speaking, discriminatory. An opinion on it's own isn't discrimination, even if it is crass.

As far as leaving, I wouldn't, always make them fire you if leaving is about a medical condition."

An employer may offer to let you start later as an accommodation, or if they're really generous provide WFH accommodations depending on your role, but there's nothing requiring them to do so if it presents an undue hardship to their operations or there's an alternate accommodation that is equally effective. An accommodation is to allow you to do your job, not to give you want you want.

It sounds like you want unlimited time off, even if unpaid, to be used at your discretion when you have a Type 1 issue. No employer will agree to that. In the U.S. I would suggest applying for FMLA, but I'm not sure if there's a UK equivalent law.

Was diagnosed when I was rushed to the hospital with blood glucose levels in the 900s. Been struggling most of my life with type 1 diabetes. I know what it’s like to be constantly tired. I also know that I live paycheck to paycheck and my family, while not poor, also had to struggle to pay the bills. My mother was forced to pawn her wedding ring to pay for groceries. At no point in my life have I thought it acceptable to miss work because I was too tired. Seriously, you are insanely privileged if that is even a consideration for you."

I don’t have any delusions about the “average company”, but that isn’t a reason to not at least try to seek out accommodations. We owe it to ourselves to try. And when we don’t try, we enable the status quo. I know not everyone - most people, honestly - can take that risk, but if we can, we should. It helps move the needle forward.

Literally every job I have had in the UK, from working in McDonalds to being a software developer, has been very accommodating without me having to ask for anything. Asking for something ahead panics companies as they start to expect problems rather than the reality of it not affecting them much at all.

And I agree with what others have said. If sleep is broken enough times that you need to warn HR about it then that itself is not normal and should be addressed. The OP has basically said to HR ""I am a badly controlled diabetic"" by making it sound like it is a regular occurrence.

Also not, again, that the majority of the ""advice"" in this thread has been very US-centric and doesn't really apply to the UK. Especially, as previously mentioned, the concept of sick days and worrying about if you have enough to cover your illness.

But one area where I admit I do differ to most people in this thread is that I do not see diabetes as a ""disability"". It is an illness I have, but disabled? What exactly is that there that I cannot do? You know, the definition of what being disabled is?

But thank you for finally accepting, four or five comments later, that I didn't actually bully anyone at all."

Not directly related but I'd be curious to know what your stance on people who have periods taking time off every month for several days because of ""something they can't control"" that causes extremely similar amounts of fatigue, pain, and irritability. I'm not accusing you of having a negative response to that, but it's a different perspective that relates directly to your situation."

Only been diabetic for 3years. I don’t use it as an excuse. If my diabetes is bad and my blood sugars are all over the place and I’m extremely fatigued and burned out, I feel like that’s a valid excuse to not work. Fair enough, you power on through and don’t miss a day or maybe you don’t even get those bad diabetes days. Regardless, we may have the same condition but how it affects us is different."

I advised them to rethink whether what they were doing was necessary. A child could see this.

Regarding the rest, I disagree with it. I know that many don't see it that way and I am allowed to disagree with it. I even pointed out that I know that my view is different to most on this. My reasoning is that seeing it as a ""disability"" creates a victim mentality that is well seen in this thread, where people expect the world to bend to them. Remember again, this whole discussion is because someone thinks they have a right to be treated differently because they might be tired from nighttime hypos. That is maintaining a victim mentality.

This is also a super common way of looking at things. People don't want to be defined by what others see as a disability. Think of deaf people that see being deaf as being part of their culture rather than a disability. There's even people who disagree with the word ""disability"" in general and prefer dysability. As I am pretty sure you are going to be unaware of this, I'll explain it: ""dis"" implies ""cannot do"" and ""dys"" implies ""has difficulty doing"". This has been a discussion for decades, for example I remember first hearing about it when I was at University in the nineties.

I am allowed to disagree and I was clear it was my opinion. Apparently you struggle with these things.

(I have, but by no means advise, taken my pump off and put it in my purse and walked through the scanners as normal).

Someone has looked at my insulin vials once because it was in a weird container.

Do your reading on what your equipment can go through re: airport scanners. If you need to request a pat down. The tsa agents are super familiar, just tell the person by the metal detector that you need a pat down for a medical device.

I have flown with needles, vials, pump, cgm etc and had no issues.

Tip #1 put all your medical needs in your carry on. This is temp controlled, easy to access, and always under your control 

Tip #2 bring extra supplies. 2-3× what you think you'll need. Back ups on back ups babyyyy

Tip #3 if you are really anxious about if your overhead bag will be on board or you'll be forced to gate check, you can board with those needing extra time. You want to ensure your medical supplies are near you. This is reasonable and has been used by people here before. You can also fix this by putting your supplies in a bag that goes under the seat in front of you.

Tip #4 people fly with t1d all the time. Tsa, gate agents, etc are familiar with the supplies. You don't need to disclose that it's t1d specifically. But you should feel comfortable saying the trigger words ""I have a medical device"" ""those are my medical supplies and medications "" people get it, so don't worry!!

Tip #5  I think technically you could get an exception to bring fluids, but I opt for gummies instead of juice for easier travel and less questions.

Tip #6 the above are true for every single country or airpott I've been to so far, whether or not it's English speaking"

So if the airport website recommends showing up 2 hours before departure, I showed up -2:30. 

Carry all your medical items in one bag including snacks for lows, and never check medications. You don't want to be separated from them for any duration. Some airlines will allow a medical bag separate from carry-ons, so you may be able to take your medical bag, purse, and carry-on, all with no additional fees. When I flew with alaska they didn't count the medical bag separate so it was considered a personal item like a purse. 

I didn't need a doctors note, it's stuff they see every day. I have a CGM and a pump, so I had them do a manual pat down instead of going through the full body scanner. 

Carry extras of all medications and devices, so if you use a CGM bring extra sensors and a conventional glucometer. If you plan on being away for 5 days, take 10 days of medications. Even if your insurance works where you will be it can still be hard to get replacements temporarily."

The TSA was very understanding didn't do a thing with it. The flight people that normally charge for EVERYTHING (Frontier) didn't mind at all and understood. I think you will be fine.

Nowadays I just clip it into my g banger like a grown up. 

Seriously though I feel for T1D women. As id it wasn't already hard enough you have to do life as a diabetic without pockets.  Ridiculous.

Advice for medical supply frequency shipping issue,"Hello all

I'm looking for some guidance and advice on a recurring problem my wife, who is a type 1 diabetic, is facing with her medical supply distributor, Solara Medical Supply. We've been experiencing ongoing shipping issues that have been quite frustrating and inconvenient for her.

Here's the problem: Solara Medical Supply claims that they lack the necessary documentation from the hospital to process the shipment of my wife's omnipod supplies. However, whenever we reach out to the hospital, they confirm that they have indeed sent the requested documentation. Unfortunately, there is always a significant delay between Solara receiving the documentation and processing it, which causes unnecessary delays in receiving the supplies. My wife has reached out to them 5 times already and generally is on hold for 1-3 hours each call

I'm wondering if anyone here knows of any government agencies that regulate medical supply distributors. I'm hoping to find some assistance or guidance on how to address these substantial issues caused by Solara Medical Supply. It's becoming increasingly burdensome for my wife to have to constantly get involved and push them to ship the supplies she needs.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Call your insurance company and find out who you can use as a distributor. Then try to find one that’s a small regional vendor, as they seem to be amazing."

I haven't tried it for orders yet, but will about a month before I run out.

In fact, there is a passage in John that might be useful:

“The disciples asked him, ‘Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?’

“‘Neither this man nor his parents sinned,’ said Jesus, ‘but this happened that the works of God might be displayed through him.’”

You might also look for the passages like the beatitudes (especially the version that starts in Luke 6:20) which talks about how the people who suffer now will have their reward later. 

Or 2 Corinthians 4:16 - “Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, inwardly we are renewed day by day.”

Honestly, I am not much into the “literal” faith of Christianity. But I go to church almost every week and find the messages useful and comforting. I probably considered myself more of an atheist 25 years ago before I was diagnosed than I do now.

And also, diabetes isn’t the end of your life! My life has been awesome so far, and diabetes is just one small part of it. I am so grateful I was born in the second half of the 20th century and have gotten to see the technology for treatments improve so much. I never could have dreamed when I was diagnosed in 1998 that a machine would be checking my blood sugar every 5 minutes and adjusting my insulin dosing automatically, even while I’m sleeping. That to me is a modern miracle, to use a religious term!"
Faith after diagnoses,I have always been super religious and always believed in god and a Christian. But it is so hard to believe I did stuff to deserve this disease that other people haven’t done or have done worse and am wondering if any of y’all still believe after being diagnosed.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14lym83/faith_after_diagnoses/,You are not being punished with diabetes.

I don’t see type 1 diabetes as a punishment. I see as a superpower! We literally do the work of an organ every second of every single day. We can still do the things we did before; except produce our own insulin obviously but the fact we have to pause for a second & plan it out means we often do it better. Look how many non diabetics want our tech!!! The fact that we are constantly doing calculations, planning ahead etc makes us warriors not victims. Diabetes should have to live with us not us live with it. 

I’ve had it now for 48yrs with no complications despite not always taking the best care of myself. The tech we now have makes life so much easier!!! Some of you older ones may remember have surgical steel & glass syringes with only 2 needles that were 8in inches long! And those needles had to last us years no matter how blunt they got. Thank goodness things have progressed enormously since the dark ages!

So flip the coin over so to speak. If you believe in God (and no judgement for that; we all need something to help us through life) consider instead of it being a punishment maybe it’s Gods way of saying you are chosen to go into the World & show others your strength. Give hope & encouragement to others in the same place as you & show them just how powerful the human spirit can be"

There's cancer and blindness and all kinds of worse outcomes.

  
There was a girl that was the cheerleading captain and prom queen and all that that graduated from my HS a couple years ahead of me who I only found out years later via Facebook was involved in a bad car crash after HS and is now mostly paralyzed in a wheelchair that she controls w/ her mouth. 😬

There’s a book by Harold Kushner I highly recommend. He was a Jewish rabbi, highly held in Jewish and interfaith circles. It’s called When Bad Things Happen To Good People. It’s primarily about death and grieving, but it also fits here. 

Basically, it’s the notion that God created the universe and set the laws of physics and chance it to motion, but cannot control the outcome or who it will strike. Sometimes, life is just random, and there’s no other reason behind it. 

I’m also religious, but Jewish. I don’t think God had anything to do with my disease, but God can provide support and strength through it."

Being Christian and having faith in God =\= doing something “bad” to “deserve” it. I don’t believe it works that way and I’ve always had a strong faith life. Honestly I don’t know how I would have made it the almost 50 years with this condition if I didn’t. 

I was fortunate that, even back in the 70s when I was diagnosed, my pastor was an intelligent, enlightened person and my particular denomination didn’t ask me to check my brain at the door. He said it was ok to be angry and it was even ok to be angry at God but to take advantage of the doctors and insulin to stay alive. 

There have been times when I’ve given the almighty a piece of my mind. (Think of Tevye’s talks with God in Fiddler on the Roof but with a little more screaming.) I think it’s good for those of us who believe to vent to God once in a while—screaming, crying, swearing and all. God can handle it. 

Hang in there. Ignore the people who say ignorant things like you somehow deserved it. Ignore the people who want to cherry pick scripture to beat you over the head. You didn’t “do” anything to “deserve” this and you and God know that. That’s all that matters."

I know it’s tough after a diagnosis, but your life will go on. You will still see beauty, you will still feel joy. You just have an additional burden placed upon you, but as time goes on and you become better adjusted, it’ll be apart of the background noise of your life.

 Youre not being punished my dear. Nothing you did made this happen.

Don't look at the crashing waves as Peter did. Look at Christ. Christ alone is your salvation, not the circumstances. Matthew 14:29-30-31
I've had some thoughts/ circumstances or even hypothetical questions from others of 'well where is He if you're going through this?'
He's here.
He saw me through my initial diagnosis when I was 5 with a blood sugar over 700 and He saw you through it as well.
He's still here watching over you and us and keeping us during the night and our highs and lows. He is faithful to see you through until tomorrow if it's granted to us. 
If it's our time, then joy! I get to be with the Lord. 

""We are confident, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and at home with the Lord.""
2 Corinthians 5:8 TLV

I view myself as someone who belongs to Christ first, everything else is secondary. 

Stay close your Shepherd, for He will provide for peace, for anything in your life.

Extra Omnipods Gen 3 & 5,"TLDR: Pharmacist messed up and gave me wrong generation Omnipods. Three Gen 3 pods, and Five Gen 5 pods. If anyone needs them please send me a PM Id like to give them to someone who needs them :) 

Hello y'all, Id like to share a story.
 
  A couple years ago in the height of the pandemic I was a struggling college student working a part-time job with no Health insurance. As a Type 1 diabetic this was beyond challenging, I had to scrap every last penny I had to afford insulin. One night I was completely overwhelmed after I had to spend $300 on a vial of novolin R. I didn't even have money for dinner. I wrote this super long post here ranting about that frustration. Someone read that and sent me a PM. He later sent me a box of 5 Novolog pens that he had extra. That act of kindness was enough to give me the leeway to focus my time and energy on Health insurance and a better job. Furthermore it gave me Hope where I had none. It reminded me that even though we all experience life differently, we are never alone and there are others who genuinely care. 

With that, my Pharmacy wrongly gave me 2 boxes of the wrong generation Omnipods and then after I wasted 2 pods because they weren't connecting to my PDM the pharmacy said keep them. 

I have no use for them because I have the gen 5 (Dexcom G6 compatible), which is incompatible with the Gen 3 & Regular Gen 5. I know it's confusing for me too lol. 

I have Three of the Gen 3 Pods and Five of the Gen 5 pods I'd like to give to someone who needs it. Send me a PM if your interested have a great day :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14lht68/extra_omnipods_gen_3_5/,The ones you are calling gen 5…do they have a blue tab?

You can try & call your doc's office & tell them what's up. Back in the day doc offices had sample of medications so maybe they can have some they can give him to tide him over (though it's been a while since that's eben the case). 

If it's looking like you can't make any of those options work in time, just go to the ER. If you wait too long & he's out of insulin he'll go into a ketoacidosis & fall into a coma.

The last time I did so b/c of this exact same scenario about 10 years ago I almost wound up in a coma. It has a much longer action duration and ""peaks"", meaning that at some point it will be hitting him harder than it was when he took it several hours ago. The modern insulins were created largely to avoid ""peaks"".

If you're contemplating going to WM, might as well just go ahead and go to the ER b/c there's a good chance you're going to wind up there in worse shape if he tries taking the WM shit instead. I don't mean to scare you, but that WM shit is total garbage."

I have a relatively low appetite now that I think about it, but since diagnosis I’ve gradually become very food focused. I think constantly monitoring your meals and thinking about food can cause some disordered eating habits. It did for me.

If you have physical hunger however, that doesn’t apply. Not sure what diabetes-related issue would be causing that, other than maybe large fluctuations in BG throughout the day."

> Amylin, or islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), is a 37-residue peptide hormone. It is co-secreted with insulin from the pancreatic β-cells in the ratio of approximately 100:1 (insulin:amylin). Amylin plays a role in glycemic regulation by slowing gastric emptying and promoting satiety, thereby preventing post-prandial spikes in blood glucose levels.

It's not the only satiation-related hormone, but it is one.

Synthetic amylin is a thing, see Pramlintide.  No idea about any details, I only found out about amylin a month or two ago."

I have the same thing - no amount of food truly feels satisfying. I feel like I could eat forever.

IMHO, this is partially a diabetes issue as in I believe it stems from the food-focused nature of the condition, but I doubt its a result of any medications or hormonal imbalances since your bloodwork is fine. Most likely purely mental. 

I’ve had this for 8 years now - it’s been a struggle to say the least. For me, the only thing that really works is distracting myself - I go on a lot of walks to coffee shops that are ~30 min away to buy a black coffee, just to occupy myself for an hour or so. I also spend a lot of time in the gym resistance training. I basically just try to “waste” as much time as possible with stuff throughout the day…cleaning house, cleaning car, reorganization, taking my time cooking, etc. Recently also bracelet making lol

**My absolute best advice:** find some hobbies to take your mind off food, hobbies that truly make you feel fulfilled and happy.

Edit: I didn’t mean for this to come across as “just find a hobby that makes you happy and all your problems will go away.” There are medications like Ozempic and Trulicity that can really help, but in my opinion, and from my experience which is similar to OP’s, getting your mentality straight is equally as important. I had to work on shifting my focus away from food to see any long-term changes, and for me creating distractions and finding hobbies that I truly enjoyed really helped."
Anyone else unable to feel full?,"Hey all,

Ive struggled with this for some time now. I genuinely cannot feel full, even on days where I overindulge and eat 3500 calories in a day. Ill occasionally get a stomach ache from eating too much and then within an hour I am hungry again. I am a normal weight / height at 6’3, 175 lbs 25M. I drink 128 oz of water per day. I have a normal thyroid. I just cant feel full and its causing my bloodsugars to never be stable because im constantly snacking. I never NOT finish a meal and I think I suffer from some sort of anxiety with food security? I dont know how to describe it but my anxiety goes up with hunger and then ill let myself go and binge eat on bad days.

   Once the sun goes down and it's dinner time, I have the same problem as you! I have gastroparisis, and so I'm never hungry. I eat and then I want more. Nothing ever sounds good, so it tends to be snake food because it's easy. 

   I'm not comfortable in my own skin right now and hate taking my stepson to the pool. I feel fat! My husband says I'm beautiful, but I don't feel it. 

   I always feel bloated and full. Then I eat, and I feel like sh*t. My upper stomach starts hanging over my pants. I've tried to get help and my gastroenterologist offered to put a valve in my stomach to the outside of my body to relieve gas.

Edit: Also, OP mentions food anxiety and episodes of bingeing, and clarified that they don’t really feel physically hungry. Amylin has worked as an appetite regulator for many, yes - but to me, this doesn’t sound like an appetite issue."

You shifted one macro (carbs) which was your problem area : overeating trigger, whatever. And inadvertently took a huge chunk out of your calorie count. 
Figure out your BMR, base metabolic rate (easy calculators online) that’s how many calories your body burns at rest just existing based on your height, weight, age and activity level. That will tell you the tipping point for weight loss, aka you’re likely eating at a deficit still.

It also increases during  higher intensity exercise. It can surpass 1.0 if the lactate threshold is reached during exercise but that’s due to non metabolic CO2, not from carbohydrate oxidation

In this case is it ok to wait under  70 for some time ?",https://i.redd.it/j3mr2qfrbm8b1.jpg,"Nah, long-term issues are very rare and require consistent lows for a long period of time, usually only affecting people who have lost awareness.  Don't fret about the long-term stuff in general. Do your best. I have done a pretty job over 21 years and have no Type one complication to report of. My eyes are better than my non-diabetic brother and the only other thing is my gums could be seen as less than healthy, but that is also my genetics. I guess what I am saying is to do your best, keep them in range, and avoid drastic lows. Especially for young kids as acute episodes of lows can have serious side effects that are very much more serious than the potential of long-term low side effects. 

You did great and are doing a fantastic job."

Newly Diagnosed Kid - tips? Accessories? Must haves?,"Our 5 year old son was diagnosed last week and we are currently making it through day by day. We have a meeting next week to discuss CGM and other options. Does anyone have any tips to share or accessories that have been helpful (carrying cases, etc)? Any and all advice is welcome. 

He’s doing very well but seems to be acting out a bit more than usual…we’re assuming the stress of it all is showing in this type of behavior. So any advice on how to help guide him through all of this is also welcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14kjpgt/newly_diagnosed_kid_tips_accessories_must_haves/,"Welcome the club no one wants to be in😬. But putting that aside a CGM is probably going to be one of the best diabetes management tools you can get. The one most people seem to like and the one I have is Dexcom(G6). They’re other brands like libre and medtronic but Dexcom is typically seen as top tier. Now dexcom has just come out with the G7, but it does not work with any insulin pumps as of right now. Which is something you’re going to want to keep in mind especially if you want a pump down the road.

Most docs will probably have you wait for a pump anyways just so you can get used to MDI. I highly recommended pushing for the dexcom. Some accessories would be overpatches to help keep the CGM on. Dexcom G6 stays on for 10 days total and using these can help with making sure they stick. You can find many fun ones on some online websites that your kid would like.

I personally do not have carrying cases but many do( I just use my purse). Try going on Myabetic or Sugar Medical bc they have options and of course they’re multiple other websites. They can help keep pens/vials cool in hot weather and can be very convenient for carrying low treatments.

I’m sure the endo or whoever has most likely already told you how important it is to make sure you always have glucagon and low snacks. If you’re going to be away for awhile ALWAYS have backup. Just because you get a CGM you still need to have your meter  incase it malfunctions.

So now more on the mental health side. Type one is very exhausting mentally and physically. It takes a while get used to, especially for a little kid. Don’t make your kid a number. Try not to make your child feel bad because their sugar is high or low. There are MANY different factors that can effect BG and it’s not always someone’s fault. 

Remember he’s going through a big change right now and it’s gonna be hard. Don’t make your kid miss out on birthday party’s or candy bc of diabetes. If he gets a little a high BG from a birthday party, don’t freak out.  It just creates a negative narrative around food and will only cause problems. Sometimes you have to let loose and just let him be a kid. 

I know it freaks you out but try not to restrict foods. Just learn how to bolus for it and if it’s a food that’s is very hard to bolus for try to make it a treat. Type one takes a lot of trial and error and you will mess up. Just don’t make it a big and move on. 

Sorry I wrote so much but if you have more questions just ask. Remember to breathe right now because this is a lot. Staying calm will also help your child to stay calm as well."

was he in DKA when diagnosed? really high levels can make you very irritable and angry so him acting out more may be a temporary thing as his blood sugar levels get in range. 

just be there to support him and be willing to listen to him and it’ll be okay!"

It’s a very new technology and is still in trials but once you and your son are more used to diabetes it uses AI tech via a cell phone to predict lows/ highs and will adjust insulin accordingly. It is set up online and is kind of technical but there may be local resources to help you set it up. Also make sure to make sure your son’s school is aware of diabetes care and will let him have a cell phone/ devices on him to manage it on his own.  For taxes you should look into any disability tax credits and there are lots of Facebook groups with tips on how to get approved. Insulin will go bad in the heat so for summer outings I would get a frio bag to travel with insulin safely. 
Insulin pumps/ Dexcom also have lots of 3rd party sellers that make fun patches to keep them attached so that might be fun for a small kid.

I got diabetes as an adult, but I have heard that lots of kids struggle with mental health around their diabetes so I would consider getting a child friendly therapist for him to talk through these big emotions, and look into local diabetes groups or even summer camps for him to bond with other kids with diabetes.

Lastly (less importantly) when/ if he decides to go to college make sure he is registered as a disabled student because there will be big disability grants via student loans (i didn’t know this till my last school term, missed out on big money). Im in Canada but from what I have seen there are lots of these grants available elsewhere."

Dexcom Sensor Reuse?,"Hey all, so I wear a g6 and a t-slim pump and i had an issue replacing my sensor this morning. I did the set up through my phone as usual while my pump was charging. After the warm-up, I got to grab my pump and it’s telling me signal loss, so i figured it just was out of range to pick up the fact that i replaced my sensor and did the warm up, so i went into settings, stopped sensor and restarted it, but it reset the whole warmup process! Then I get a message an hour into the new warm up session and it says something along the lines of “no sensor reuse please replace” but it’s brand new! anything i can do? thanks in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14kp6zx/dexcom_sensor_reuse/,"Usually, if it gives you out of range it should pick it back up within 5-10 minutes. Since we're past that point: Do you have any more sensors you can use? If you do, just use a new one, go to Dexcom support and see if they'll send you a new one: [https://dexcom.custhelp.com/](https://dexcom.custhelp.com/)  
They should get back to you w/in 24 hours. Tell them the new one gave you an error and it wouldn't warmup.

If you still have the sensor attached to your body, have you ever used the credit card trick? You can slide some credit/debit/giftcards (or a think guitar pick up either side of the sensor & unlatch the inserted transimmter, pop it out, wait 25 mins, and then pop it in & reuse the same code). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx-kTsrkNUM&t=192s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx-kTsrkNUM&t=192s) 

It's a bit of an arduous process but could save you from having to toss an otherwise good sensor. Also, if you have a standard fingerprick sugar meter make sure you check it on that & compare to CGM b/c I've found after reusing a sensor it will come in w/ higher than normal sugars readings sometimes & you have to calibrate it to make sure it's give you accurate readings.

Lastly, going forward, always start the CGM from the T:Slim pump itself, as starting it from the phone app is known to cause issues w/ reporting readings to the pump for some reason and can lead to false dropped signal errors."

The Dexcom transmitter controls the state and sensor session, it doesn’t matter what device it’s started with at all. 

However, with the Tandem it sometimes happens that people start a sensor on the phone and then on the pump start it as well immediately after but hit “skip code”. That’s a problem. If the phone hasn’t spoken to the transmitter yet, which can take up to 5 minutes, and the pump subsequently talks to it first instead of the phone: the sensor session will be started without code and you’ll be forced to calibrate it, which sucks. So either wait a few minutes before also starting on pump (if it doesn’t pick it up by itself, usually you don’t actually have to do anything at all on the Tandem after starting on the phone (unless your transmitter is changing), it’ll synchronise the session with the transmitter within 5 to 10 minutes) or also enter the code on the pump. 

The only thing you should stay very far away from is starting a sensor by using the phone camera to read the sensorcode."

If you have that kind of reaction to gluten, it’s worth getting tested for celiac disease. It’s super common when you have T1. You need to eat loads of gluten for at least 6 weeks before getting the blood test to get an accurate result though.

Celiac disease is a serious condition that can make you really, really ill over time. I like to preach to the masses to try and help people avoid what I went through before I was diagnosed!"

"Type1 spouse here, any tips?","My fiancée has type 1 diabetes, Gastroparesis, PNES (non epileptic seizures (stress induced), thyroid disease and probably a couple others. 
She was diagnosed with t1 when she was 2 and our local hospital is ass. I read about other t1’s going to the hospital for an IV and such when in DKA. I have CARRIED her into the hospital at least twice now,  and it’s just referral after referral and the appointment is 6 months out. But she’s sick now. Sometimes I call the hospital angry like when she didn’t get zofran (she uses it everyday) and they listen but only after that. Side note, any recommendations on nausea meds? She grew a tolerance to zofran and is taking like 8-12mg daily and complains about heart flutters so I told her to lay off it, but there’s no replacement of the med she needs until 6 months for the referral… the ER just gives fluids and temporarily gives like Finnegan (or however you spell it). 

She just got a referral from the GI to a doctor that can treat everything wrong with her all at once (I forgot the name) instead of all these separate ones. That’s good right? I’m trying to find a light at the end of the tunnel that I can tell her so she’ll have some mental ease. She’s tired of being in pain which I obviously understand. 

Any tips from t1’s that you can give me that I can be doing that’s like extra which can help her more? She never eats really, never drinks water (gets nauseous everytime there’s a sip taken). I wish I could just give her IVs at home but I read and know that’s a big no no especially for dka.

It sounds like that GI doctor is a good place to start. There isn't any one diabetic diet, but it sure sounds like she needs help figuring out her GI. Until that is figured out, the T1 is just going to exacerbate and complicate things. Most T1s without gastroparesis work on carb counting, insulin to carb ratios, long and short acting insulins and such. If diet and drinking water are hard, it's tough to give advice without that condition as well.

As far as T1, is she seeing an endocrinologist? She has other endocrine issues so maybe they would have some ideas. The endocrinologist might help with some protocols for avoiding DKA. You are right, you sometimes hop from one medical silo to another.

Maybe this reddit would help:

Does she have a gastroenterologist? If not, she needs to have someone work with her. A dietitian might help too. I have gastroparesis and I spent some time inpatient because I couldn’t hold anything down. Thankfully my gastroparesis is very episodic. Once that flare calmed down, I went back to a mostly regular diet. 

They used a number of anti nausea medication on me during my stay. Gravol was the first line, then Zofran, then Maxeran and finally haldol with cogentin. She may need to do something similar. Start with one drug, then take another if it’s not helping. 

Certain foods will set it off. Usually for me it’s high fat or greasy foods, certain high fibre vegetables and too much red meat. I frequently feel nauseous in the mornings so I tend to eat simpler carbohydrates then and dose for them. I also really like smoothies with easy to digest fruit, yogurt, milk and whey protein. 

As for idiots in the ER, I have the choice of 2 hospitals near me. I choose the larger teaching hospital usually if the visit is due to my autoimmune illnesses vs a sprain or simple cut."

She was 32 I think when she got it done, diabetic since around 12.  The waiting list for kidney/pancreas is waaaaaay shorter than just the kidney list.  But my sister was in active kidney failure and on dialysis.  I wouldn't necessarily pursue it unless she's at that point.  I think she was on the list around a year?

Her biggest issues were that she had low blood pressure, which isn't the norm, and there aren't a lot of medications to help when it's low since most people struggle with it being too high.  She collapsed in the bathroom and broke her cheek.  Her other issue is that her pancreas is almost too good and if she has stuff that has too many simple carbs, it makes her drop low.  So a few times a month she gets down to the 40s if she isn't careful.

Plus now she has lots of pills, blood work, doctor appointments, etc because of the realities of being a transplant recipient and the fear of being immuno-compromised in a COVID world.

But good news, she just had her first kid a month ago!  Her transplant team had never dealt with someone being pregnant (often older people get it done or they don't succeed in getting pregnant) so it is possible if you and your fiance go down that path.  :)"

Tips for low blood sugar?,What tips do you guys have for low blood sugar? So I’ve been a type 1 diabetic for 20 years now and an issue I’ve always had is overeating extremely when my numbers drop. It’s frustrating because it’ll cause my levels to go up and then I’ll yo-yo between high/low. But now it’s been extra frustrating because I’ve been trying to lose weight by exercising and counting calorie intake but when my numbers drop it’s like get I possessed and have to eat everything in sight. I never really noticed it before because I wasn’t keeping track of my calories but this causes me to go over my daily intake by a lot and I feel real shitty afterwards. Was just wondering what are some good tips or advice to discipline or control myself when I get low. Thank you in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14k01hz/tips_for_low_blood_sugar/,"(Edit: It seems like your issue is controlling the ravenous hunger when you’re low, not how to fix the low itself. If not disregard my comment lol)

I used to address the low with something yummy/desserty but I found that it made the cravings for more infinitely worse…

So now my strategy is to fix the low with something not super palatable (fruit snacks, fruit leather, even those gu energy gel packs, whatever you don’t like thattt much but still has fast carbs in it). 

And then I tell myself “If you still want it, you can have that [insert craving here] after at least 20 minutes, and only when BG is above [insert goal here, mine is above 110].”

Once my BG was in range, I’d be much more likely to have the discipline to say no."

If you're trying to be healthy, you can have fruit or juice instead of candy. 75g of grapes or 100g of cherries is 15g carbs. Get a food scale to measure. Or have 4 oz. (half a cup) of OJ, I think. Check the label."

I have extreme gastroparesis and don't digest food well, especially when low. I use 5 units of glucagon, drawn in a u-100 insulin syringe, to bring my blood sugar up 50-60 mg/dl. Taken subcutaneously (into the fat layer like insulin), this hits within 15 minutes and takes the need for snacking out of the equation. There has been work on developing an insulin pump that uses glucagon as well as insulin for many years now. This is how healthy people regulate their blood sugar normally. If you are interested in learning more about microdosing glucagon, I would be happy to provide information. It can be expensive, depending on your insurance and your doctor's willingness to prescribe for this use, but is common treatment for juvenile patients (especially very young T1s), those with gastroparesis, can be used to aid weight-loss, and is in general safe, effective, and has no real side effects (though excessive use can lessen the bodies ability to respond in an emergency - you have only a limited amount of stored sugar and it takes time to replace it - not typically a problem for microdosing, but using a full dose of glucagon can wipe out all reserves)."
Tips for low blood sugar?,What tips do you guys have for low blood sugar? So I’ve been a type 1 diabetic for 20 years now and an issue I’ve always had is overeating extremely when my numbers drop. It’s frustrating because it’ll cause my levels to go up and then I’ll yo-yo between high/low. But now it’s been extra frustrating because I’ve been trying to lose weight by exercising and counting calorie intake but when my numbers drop it’s like get I possessed and have to eat everything in sight. I never really noticed it before because I wasn’t keeping track of my calories but this causes me to go over my daily intake by a lot and I feel real shitty afterwards.

Thank you in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14k01hz/tips_for_low_blood_sugar/,Yes! I think I should’ve worded this a little differently. Controlling the cravings during a low is my issue. Its almost like I go into a fight or flight mode and just keep eating. It sucks because it’s like I know what I’m *supposed* to do but have trouble controlling myself.

The intention there was to remove the extra calories from the correction food. 

But I found that if I started eating my meal when I was low, I’d absolutely raid my fridge/pantry afterwards. So at the end of the day, wayyy more calories than the 60-100 cal correction snack. 

So now I don’t let myself eat my planned meal until my BG is above like 80/90. You might not have a problem with that, but figured I’d mention it"

Thank you in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14k01hz/tips_for_low_blood_sugar/,"I have never had any issue with microdosing glucagon exacerbating my gastroparesis. I haven't used a full dose of glucagon since 2015, but remember it making me sick in general for about 24 hours, both before my gastro started and after. Low blood sugars definitely make my gastro worse - I digest nothing at all if I get down to 60 mg/dl, but that happens before treating with glucagon. At 60 it can take over 2 hours to bring my sugar up with glucose or apple juice, even sucking on it to bypass the gut (pure sugars can be absorbed through the walls of the cheek and don't have to hit the stomach to digest - a good trick when sick and nauseous), so microdosed glucagon is a life saver! My gastro also gets worse with stress. Low blood sugars are a lot of stress on the body, as are high blood sugars, and both definitely make life worse. Exams, other health issues, getting into an argument, drinking caffeine, and anything that causes increased stress hormones can cause a problem for me. Glucagon is one of the stress hormones, so it could make sense for it to cause you issues, but I think cortisol is my primary issue. I don't have any problem following a microdose of glucagon, or at least nothing worse than the stop in digestion that occurs just by dropping to 60, the point when I typically use it. I start trying to treat at 80 using apple juice (what I'm doing right now), though this is hit and miss."

Thank you in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14k01hz/tips_for_low_blood_sugar/,"I was diagnosed in Oct 1990, so I'm 32 years in and counting. They had me try a liquid diet, but I also have chronic diarrhea (this shouldnt be possible as the entire digestive tract is usually either fast or slow, but I have both problems at once compounding treatment), and that is far worse than the gastroparesis when it comes to regular life interruption. I have tried all kinds of medications, but they always make one problem worse. Today I'm on 3 meds for the chronic diarrhea (this is barely sufficient to allow me to live a fairly normal life - though I carry a change of clothing with me at all times) but that causes my gut to be slower than it otherwise would be. I was on a no fiber diet for many years and got regular gastric lavages (basically an endoscopy where they pressure wash the stomach) every 3-4 months as the stomach reached maximum capacity. It has been stretched out, so it's like the size of a small watermelon, and we know it's ""full"" when I start having difficulty swallowing anything. About 2 years ago, I was also diagnosed with EPI, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - the pancreas not making sufficient digestive enzymes, and going on medication for that has helped my gastroparesis significantly. I am back eating modest amounts of fiber and have been able to go a year or longer between gastric lavages.

Early on in my gastroparesis, before I lost my ability to vomit (my muscles no longer contract to expell food from the stomach), I would get violently ill about once a week. Imagine the worst possible food poisoning. This was because it took so long for the food to digest that it went bad in my stomach. This was happening for several years. At the time, I almost never ate anything and lived mostly on coke (which doctors later prescribed to attempt to non surgically break up the bezoars - so there was a reason I felt best doing this). I can't imagine that food sitting in my stomach is healthy now, but it doesn't have the same immediacy when you can ignore it for months. 

My doctors have talked about doing a gastric bypass to remove my stomach, but I don't trust the surgeons to do it. They have repeatedly insisted it would cure my diabetes (even after I remind them I am T1) and tout the advantages of weight loss (I am overweight but would not qualify for a bypass without medical need - I'm close to being too low a BMI to qualify even for a medical cause) but have no experience doing it for medical purposes and can't discuss the advantages/disadvantages with me. Based on internet research they also want to do a less effective procedure (stapling off the stomach instead of removing it and rerouting the bile ducts) which would mean they would have to insert a gtube (a port to the outside of the body for gas escape and clean out) which makes me very uncomfortable. My biggest concern is the frequency with which a standard bypass procedure causes diarrhea issues (mine is barely controlled sufficiently to have any chance at doing normal activities as is) and that it causes gastroparesis in a good percentage of cases (as the digestive enzymes are not introduced until food reaches the intestines - making all digestion occur there). COVID surgical shutdowns took me off track for getting the bypass done, and I still haven't been ready to start the process again."

Anyway mine seems to be more episodic.  I think my stomach is slow normally, I usually only feel hunger once or twice a week.  But when things get really bad I also get the “rotting” food thing where I burp horrendous sulphuric burps and throw up what I can only describe as solid food.  It’s awful and is extremely uncomfortable!  The more I move the better off I am, also the less I eat the better off I am.  I stay away from tough to digest foods like lettuce and other tough veggies and meats are mainly fish or other seafood bc that seems to go down better.  Funny you mentioned diarrhea bc everytime I have a bad episode it’s followed fairly quickly by diarrhea.  I haven’t been able to figure that one out at all!!

That would have had you starting this journey on porcine insulin and urine testing. It was hard enough to manage in 1990 (Oct 5th) at 12 (humulin R and NPH, and 2 minute blood glucose testing using the color change test strips for my Accucheck II), I don't envy your childhood. My little brother was diagnosed at 3, 22 years ago. I remember trying to dose his insulin using a syringe with only 1 unit markings. We used fat and skinny units (lining up an edge of the plunger with an edge of the line) and 1/2 units by sight while trying to keep him in range. With 4 of us taking care of him (my parents, myself - I was in my early 20s, and my little sister - about 18), it was a real challenge staying on the same page. I can't even imagine trying to keep a baby healthy and safe in the dark ages of diabetes - it's still hard enough today!!

Having stuff in your stomach after 3 days on a liquid diet is definitely not a good sign. They will need to plan to sedate you fully for any procedure in the future, as there is a severe risk of aspiration going under the twilight drugs or lesser sedation. They can't be sure your stomach will be empty no matter what prep they do, unfortunately. I hope that your symptoms stay stable or, better yet, improve with time. 

I think one of my biggest problems was that my issues started before gastroparesis was a diagnosis (at least for diabetics). I complained of digestive inconsistencies for over 10 years, where eating the same meal at the same time on two consecutive days had vastly different results in blood sugar. This was back before cgms were available (about the time of the first dexcom device's production), so I could only offer fingerstick results, and they easily dismissed it. In order to deal with the days I couldn't digest anything, I started purposely running high blood sugars, which only made the problem progress. 10 years of growing issues and continuously being ignored by medical professionals, I reached a point where the rock of food in my stomach was so big and compacted that I couldn't even sip water and was hospitalized in horrible condition. Over those years, I had vomiting (we thought it was caused by migraines, and they gave me opiods), horrible stomach aches, and the chronic diarrhea issues began. I think if they had been willing to believe me and work on diagnosing what was happening, it would never have gotten this broken. It wasn't until they had to do emergency surgery to clean out my gut in the hospital that they even considered there might actually be a real problem. 

Similar to you, in the early days, it was definitely inconsistent. I never figured out what triggered the difference as it happened even when eating the exact same food on consecutive days with similar health, stress levels, schedule, and other conditions. I didn't have the amount of data we have today ( I was on mdi with fingersticks) to help track the problem. Getting a gastric emptying study, a barium swallow study, swallowing a pill camera, or doing any other testing early would have been great, but I'm not sure these were even possible, and they definitely wouldn't do them for me at the time.

Finding the right diet and managing both medications and stressors can definitely help make gastroparesis easier to manage. I hope that you can find a good treatment that can keep you stable and improve your quality of life. Happy early birthday!"

Yep I’m from the not so good ol days of urine testing and switching between pork and beef insulin so you didn’t become resistant to one or both.  I didn’t even have my first glucometer until 1984. I lugged that thing around in a rolling suitcase and waited 5mins for results 😂😂.  Being on a pump helps with the inconsistency of when food hits but it is frustrating trying to stay in range!  The other problem is I have a permanently dislocated shoulder.  This pain is really hard to control and unfortunately the only thing that works is opiates, which of course slows everything down a lot. So it’s a fun game of is my stomach working well enough today to not be in excruciating pain.  It’s a trade off I make often.  I wasn’t even aware that this condition is a relatively newer diagnosis.  I just assumed since it’s neuropathic in origin it would be just part of the whole t1 spectrum.  Learn something new everyday! I really do think I’m lucky to be in as good a shape as I am given how lackluster my early care had to be.  Being an athlete I think helped a bit too.

My summary of the Update on Vertex’s study VX-880. Very exciting!,"⭐️⭐️⭐️HUGE BREAKING NEWS⭐️⭐️⭐️

✅I have been waiting on pins and needles for the last THIRTEEN months for this update from Vertex. Tonight in San Diego, they finally gave the update on their VX-880 trial. To those who don’t know, VX-880 is a very exciting trial that Vertex is doing with their lab produced islet cells. They are infusing these cells through the portal vein (that feeds the liver and pancreas). 

Important: these patients are all on immune-suppressing meds to blunt the immune system attack of these new cells.

✅The last update given was on June 6, 2022. At that time the first 2 patients had been dosed with only a half dose of the cells. The first patient was 100% off of insulin, and the second patient was 30% off of insulin….and then….13 months of silence! 😡😡😤 (I just about went crazy waiting!!!)

⭐️⭐️⭐️As of today the following updates were given:

✅Let me start by saying this news is all AMAZING!

✅Since then, 4 more patients began the trial. 

✅The first 2 patients have EXTREMELY exciting news:

1️⃣Patient A1 started with an HbA1c of 8.6% at baseline and had an ➡️HbA1c of 5.3% at Month 21!!!

2️⃣Patient B1 had HbA1c of 7.6% at baseline and had an HbA1c of 6.0% at Month 12!!!

⭐️Both patients showed over 95% time-in-range!!!

⭐️⭐️⭐️In addition, these two patients are OFF INSULIN!!!

Of note: these 2 patients received 2 different half-dose infusions.

———

✅The 3 additional patients in Part B, each administered the FULL target dose of VX-880 given as a single infusion, have follow-up between 29 and 90 days and have shown:

⭐️Endogenous insulin secretion
⭐️Reduction in HbA1c
⭐️Improvements in glucose time-in-range
⭐️Reductions in daily exogenous insulin use

⭐️⭐️⭐️This is all in 3 months or less!!!

✅Their trajectory is consistent with that observed in the two patients with more than one year of follow-up at equivalent periods of follow-up after VX-880 infusion.

⭐️This is huge: All Patients with greater than 90 days of follow-up had elimination of SHEs (severe hypoglycemic events) in the evaluation period! This is because these cells aren’t just beta cells making insulin, they are the entire islet cluster including alpha cells making glucagon!

⭐️This is all so HUGE!!! This is the most exciting news in the Type 1 world since the creation of insulin in 1921 (102 years ago)!

⭐️⭐️⭐️Because of these amazing results, the trial has been approved to move to phase C with “concurrent dosing” where they can give full doses to multiple patients at the same time, where before it was 1 patient at a time separated by a certain time period. There will be about 17 patients total in this trial.

✅The VX-880 trial has expanded to additional sites that are active and enrolling in Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands.

⭐️⭐️⭐️HUGE: These same cells will be used in vertex’s next trial called VX-264⬇️

🧬About VX-264:
VX-264 is an investigational cell therapy in which allogeneic human stem cell-derived islets are encapsulated in a channel array device designed to shield the cells from the body’s immune system. VX-264 is designed to be surgically implanted and is currently being evaluated for patients with T1D. 

⭐️No immunosupression drugs given with 264.

🧬⭐️⭐️⭐️ Next Vertex trial: Research-stage hypoimmune islet cell program.

The next very exciting trial Vertex will do is where they take these same cells that have been genetically modified using CRISPR tech so that the immune system hopefully doesn’t recognize them and inject them into portal vein. This could be the holy grail! But so could 264!

Of note: One patient in Part A received a half-target dose of VX-880 and was followed for approximately nine months, at which time this patient received a second half dose. This patient subsequently withdrew consent (not related to adverse events [AEs]) and was therefore not evaluable for the primary endpoint.

⭐️I am so incredibly happy to report these amazing results to you!!! I’ve been waiting for sooooo long to hear this update!!! We all have some very exciting things coming in the future! @everyone

My summary of the Update on Vertex’s study VX-880. Very exciting!,"⭐️⭐️⭐️HUGE BREAKING NEWS⭐️⭐️⭐️

✅I have been waiting on pins and needles for the last THIRTEEN months for this update from Vertex. Tonight in San Diego, they finally gave the update on their VX-880 trial. To those who don’t know, VX-880 is a very exciting trial that Vertex is doing with their lab produced islet cells. They are infusing these cells through the portal vein (that feeds the liver and pancreas). 

Important: these patients are all on immune-suppressing meds to blunt the immune system attack of these new cells.

✅The last update given was on June 6, 2022. At that time the first 2 patients had been dosed with only a half dose of the cells. The first patient was 100% off of insulin, and the second patient was 30% off of insulin….and then….13 months of silence! 😡😡😤 (I just about went crazy waiting!!!)

⭐️⭐️⭐️As of today the following updates were given:

✅Let me start by saying this news is all AMAZING!

✅Since then, 4 more patients began the trial. 

✅The first 2 patients have EXTREMELY exciting news:

1️⃣Patient A1 started with an HbA1c of 8.6% at baseline and had an ➡️HbA1c of 5.3% at Month 21!!!

2️⃣Patient B1 had HbA1c of 7.6% at baseline and had an HbA1c of 6.0% at Month 12!!!

⭐️Both patients showed over 95% time-in-range!!!

⭐️⭐️⭐️In addition, these two patients are OFF INSULIN!!!

Of note: these 2 patients received 2 different half-dose infusions.

———

✅The 3 additional patients in Part B, each administered the FULL target dose of VX-880 given as a single infusion, have follow-up between 29 and 90 days and have shown:

⭐️Endogenous insulin secretion
⭐️Reduction in HbA1c
⭐️Improvements in glucose time-in-range
⭐️Reductions in daily exogenous insulin use

⭐️⭐️⭐️This is all in 3 months or less!!!

✅Their trajectory is consistent with that observed in the two patients with more than one year of follow-up at equivalent periods of follow-up after VX-880 infusion.

⭐️This is huge: All Patients with greater than 90 days of follow-up had elimination of SHEs (severe hypoglycemic events) in the evaluation period! This is because these cells aren’t just beta cells making insulin, they are the entire islet cluster including alpha cells making glucagon!

⭐️This is all so HUGE!!! This is the most exciting news in the Type 1 world since the creation of insulin in 1921 (102 years ago)!

For a short acting insulin example, insurances often switch folks back and forth between Humalog and Novolog and for most people it's the same, it's not a potency issue for the rest it's the absorption time, a few folks find one absorbs faster, slightly.

I would say that there are by far way more other factors with T1 that will take time to sort out but not insulin brand switches.

20 days in is the toughest time, sounds like you are doing great. The first year is a climb, so keep at it, it gets a lot better, there is just so much to learn."

Lantus and tresiba, or levemir and tresiba however.... different beast.

They have different times that they are active in the body and different lengths of time that they remain in the body even among the same type of insulin (short and long acting). This page [ADA](https://diabetes.org/healthy-living/medication-treatments/insulin-other-injectables/insulin-basics) and this page  [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type-1-types-of-insulin.html) do a pretty good job explaining the differences.

I'm not sure if I would call it a potency difference, but because of the difference in the time the insulins are active in the body, among many other factors, different insulins have varying effects. Tresiba and Toujeo work much longer so I ended up have to take them both at a much lower dose than when I took Lantus."

There is also no “tresiba low” like you can get with lantus.

I would 100% push for tresiba. 

Lantus is steady for maybe 24 hours but if it’s injected into blood stream gets absorbed extremely fast and it doesn’t always hit the 24 hour mark.

Levemir is not at all steady or consistent, it has clearly defined peaks and valleys making it by far the worst unless you are in a very niche that wants to time the peaks. I honestly can’t believe how many people have talked themselves into this garbage basal insulin.

Generic vs brand name is irrelevant theyre the same"

She is an otherwise healthy (not diabetic or with any other health issues), athletic child (competitive gymnast - level 8 doing back tucks on balance beam). I don't believe they used a heart monitor in her diagnosis. She has low but good blood pressure overall but started getting really dizzy and feeling sick all the time. She even had a major fall on the balance beam during competition, which resulted in significant injury (imagine getting super dizzy while flipping upside down over a 4"" wide balance beam that is about 2.5 feet above the ground). Luckily, she is doing much better now! Increasing her salt intake and having her wear compression socks all the time (knee high) has helped greatly. 

As a T1, autonomic neuropathy (both diabetes related and autoimmune based options exist) is another possibility. I have this issue. My blood pressure was dropping 50+ points when I went from sitting to standing (orthostatic hypotension). They gave me medication to increase my blood pressure, had me up my salt intake, and had me wear compression garments. When diagnosed, I would get really dizzy when standing up or, even more common, would suddenly become dizzy several minutes after standing. I literally passed out in the middle of walking on several occasions, injuring myself pretty badly. I am stable now without medications, but when under stress (especially physical stress from illness or injury), it flares up. It took about a year to diagnose (ruling everything else out - they even thought it could be stiff person syndrome - a terminal condition) and 2- 3 years on meds for my body to stabilize and heal before getting to a place where I am usually fine. I also don't run fevers, even with MRSA or sepsis, and have difficulty regulating my body temperature, other things handled by the autonomic nervous system.

In most cases, they primarily treat the symptoms of low blood pressure rather than the cause of it. Until they figure out what is happening increasing salt intake (constricts blood vessels), staying well hydrated (increases blood volume), and wearing compression garments (definitely knee high socks, thigh high tights, pants, tops, and sleeves are also options) can mitigate the symptoms."

A pile of blankets, sweaters, etc. does nothing except keep me from getting any colder. I must add heat from an external source - heater, heated blanket, hot water, etc - in order to ever warm up. The same is true if I get overheated (rare, but it can happen), then I need a fan, air-conditioning, or a significant amount of time in a cooler environment to cool off. I literally feel like I am cold-blooded, needing the warmth of the sun to warm up and to hide under a rock in the shade during the heat of the day! It doesn't ever seem to be anything doctors care about, even if it has a significant impact on your life. 

I personally have at least 7-8 (they haven't decided if one is autoimmune- its too rare) autoimmune illnesses, including a couple of pretty rare ones. I was a healthy child, diagnosed T1 at 12 and with hashimotos thyroiditis at 14 or 15, but my health started falling apart in my late 20s after losing my younger brother in a car accident. I developed fibromyalgia almost overnight (my little sister was diagnosed as a teenager, so it was likely anyway, but the stress triggered it) and then started on a downward spiral. As a kid, I know I had fevers, but I can't remember a single one in recent years. This includes having sepsis, requiring 2 surgeries, 3 hospitalizations, and a couple of weeks of IV antibiotics, a bone infection so serious it required amputation (because the doctors wouldn't listen to me that there was a problem - I had no fever - by the time my body started shutting down and they ran tests it was too late), and MRSA when I had a fall during physical therapy while in lock down (my amputation was 2 days into COVID lock down and I went into skilled nursing during recovery) and they refused me medical care (too much risk to let me go to the doctor) that required additional surgery (luckily not another amputation - it was close, it would have ment needing an above knee prosthetic instead of a below knee one - huge difference) and 6 weeks of IV antibiotics, in addition to having the H1N1 flu twice, and a host of other illnesses and infections over the years (luckily no COVID - knock on wood). I don't know why my body turned on me, but it definitely did. I'm 45 now, with a host of health issues. It's been over 2 years since my last diagnoses, which is well past normal (I was diagnosed with a new condition every 6-12 months for over 10 years), so I am hoping things have settled down for a while. I just finished my bachelor's degree, which I started about a year after the hospital told my parents they were sending me home to die (it only took me 7 years to finish - sepsis, mrsa, amputation, legal blindness in one eye, temporary complete blindness in the other eye (3 months), ankle surgery, along with chronic issues like T1, CIDP (autoimmune neuropathy requiring IV infusion therapy), etc - delays education for some reason...), and am hoping to be able to go back to work (job hunting now), preferably in a remote position with a flexible schedule - I'm at the doctor's office 2-4 times a week. My brain works great, but no part of my body seems to want to cooperate!!!"

For a day of this kind of physical activity, lower your basal insulin. If you have a pump, lowering basal rate is much easier and less of a guessing game. The rise in blood glucose you observed during your hike was likely due to adrenaline resulting in hepatic glucagon > glycogen >> glucose. This is expected when you're working hard (about 80% VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake)). Again, if you have pump you can easily increase basal to compensate. My pump has 6 basal profiles to match what I'm doing and the lowest is 31% of the highest (sedentary day). For a full day of skiing, I carry Chunky chocolate bars (raisin and peanuts) and nibble on them throughout the day : )

I do not keep my pump warm inside my jacket but have a pass-through to keep it in an outside pocket because body heat will denature the insulin in the pump cartridge. Denaturing pump insulin from body heat happened to me during a winter hike. After that dismal day, I use a pass-through and keep the pump in an outside pocket.

If you can, ski with a partner jic. If on CGM, just monitor it to  see trends and help avoid low BGs. Finally, always take the double diamond trails - no matter your skill level (film this for our Youtube viewing enjoyment) 😜"
I called out HR at my job for not letting me work remote due to blood sugar issues. Was I in the wrong?,"My hybrid workplace allows for 1 remote day on our required in-person days per month. Important context: leadership has frequently worked remotely while sick, beyond their 2 day per month.

Policy being enforced in a non equitable manner is a different issue and a fight you’re unlikely to win.  You can ask for reasonable accommodations for dealing with an ADA protected disability. You can also explore intermittent FMLA.  That should be in writing.  You shouldn’t work when on PTO.  Emails need to go out?  Tough.  Time off is time off.  Enforced time off preventing the completion of necessary work in the name of upholding policy has consequences. I don’t know your relationship with your boss but if it’s good you might sit down and figure out the best way to move forward.

I'm also going to write on the basis that you're FMLA eligible - been there more than 12 months, worked 1250 hours in the past year, and they have 50 employees within 75 miles.

Broadly, you're covered by two pieces of legislation: The ADA and FMLA. T1 is automatically covered under both.

The ADA afford you the ability to request reasonable accommodations. It should be an interactive process whereby you present documentation from your doctor with the accommodation request. Your employer considers it, and if they feel it's unreasonable, come back with a counteroffer.

FMLA is slightly easier in that once you're eligible, it isn't an interactive process. It isn't automatically paid, although your employer may have some internal policies around that. FMLA leave is automatically protected, and you can't be penalized for not working on FMLA>

PTO is none of these things - there is no legal obligation to not ask you to work when on PTO, and failure to do so could be disciplined. You have to be very very sure of your relationship with your boss to have a work failure because you were out on PTO.

That's not an editorial on how you handled your situation, just a fact of office life.

I would, personally, refrain from calling out inconsistency in policy application for senior staff - that gets you nowhere, and can lead to you being in the brown stuff. 

Your best bet at this stage is to get FMLA immediately, then take a breath and think about applying for an accommodation."

I need help,I’m 19 and was diagnosed when I was 15. Up until about 4 months ago I’ve really had a hard time coming to terms with this disease. At first I accepted everything that came with it and didn’t mind watching what I ate because I’m very health conscious and have a dream of being a bodybuilder. But recently it’s taken such a toll on my mental health and my days revolve around managing my blood sugar all day. I’ve also become extremely afraid of having low blood sugars because they hit me very hard now and I believe it’s because of having low body fat. My father has diabetes as well but just handles it much better than me and just doesn’t understand why I take it so serious. I see everyone around me being able to enjoy food and drinks without having to worry meanwhile I can’t even have that luxury on top of everything else this cruel world throws on you. My dream of being a bodybuilder is a joke. I can’t gain any weight no matter how hard I try. I’ve been slowly doing worse and worse in the gym. This disease has taken complete control of my life when before I barely gave it any thought. I’m literally terrified of giving myself 10 units of fast acting insulin because the amount of times I’ve been low when I was sure I counted correctly is insane. I don’t understand how I can live a life doing what I want to do when I have to manage a number that fluctuates depending on so many variables. Society just doesn’t care about us.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14jvghb/i_need_help/,"At 19, your body is still maturing so managing will be a moving target. It sounds like you're on MDI, if so, see if you can get a pump. The hypoglycemia you describe is justification for a pump. I injected for 39 years before I got my first pump in 2004 and being able to set basal rates to match what I'm doing made life so much easier. It eliminates the daily drama (of lows and highs). Most of my meals and snacks are prepared at home and I avoid all refined and processed \[non\] foods -- these wreak havoc on blood glucose. I created 6 basal profiles on my t:slim. The lowest is 31% of the highest (sedentary day) and my last 6.5 year average A1c is 5.6 (range 5.4-5.9) without hypoglycemia.

This is my 58th year on insulin, started at age 13 in 1965, 71 now, and all is well (mild retinopathy in one eye). For me. sure I have to make mindful choices about what, when, and how much to eat but it's really no different than the choices anyone, T1D or not, should make if they want long term health. And I do follow a schedule... My \[long\] story may be helpful as you navigate to a better (and less intense) path.

Also  I don't think that your low body fat has much to do with your low blood sugars. Do you wear a Dexcom or Freestyle Libre? I truly understand the fear of being low and have dealt with it for several years. I struggled with it so much and there was an unfortunate period of time where I'd force myself to eat lots of carbs so I could be high before sleeping because of this fear. I highly recommend considering therapy.

i was a college athlete before diagnosis and it took me 7 years to start truly exercising again. i have pretty low body fat too and am really insulin sensitive. lows hit me like crazy. i’ve found working out first thing in the morning helps bc i (and most diabetics) are most insulin resistant in the morning. being t1 and working out feels way different, i won’t lie, but being here and doing it feels great. i never thought i’d make it to this point. it’s totally reasonable to be so upset at this disease and take the time u need to go through those emotions as they come, but i hope this can be a bit of hope for you that it will be easier one day. 

i know a few athletes/ body builders who are t1 that i’ll link below. maybe seeing them doing it will help a little. sending you love

allergies to t:slim x2 adhesive,"Hi all! I know that allergies to adhesives for our devices are common, but the Flonase method just doesn’t really work for me and the irritation from my new pump is driving me crazy. 

I used to be on the Omnipod, but my allergies to that were similarly horrible and worse because the adhesive patch was so much bigger. I’m looking for any suggestions on how to relieve the pain and irritation because my A1C is horrible when I do MDI. Even just a week into using the t:slim x2 and I can tell my blood sugar is a lot better, so I want to continue using it. Plus, it cost a lot of money to start so I won’t just stop right away…

The only thing I can think of is changing my infusion site every day before the irritation gets too bad, but I feel like that’s such a waste and I’d really prefer a different solution.

And just for anyone who is curious, I am using the Dexcom G6 and have for years and have never had any problems with it at all. (Why can’t the pump companies offer options with the same adhesive as Dexcom! Ugh…)

Any advice would be appreciated. I saw someone on here talking about underpatches that are made of hypoallergenic materials, but when I looked into it I couldn’t find any that are made for the t:slim x2. Other than that, I have no clue where to look. 

Thanks for any suggestions!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14k59h8/allergies_to_tslim_x2_adhesive/,"Perhaps you can use an under-patch? I use my old Libre  under patches for my pump sometimes because of the allergies.

First, wipe the area with IV Prep and allow it to dry. Second, spray a layer of Benadryl spray and let it dry. It doesn’t need to be a lot, usually a spritz or two. Third, dab on skin tac and let it dry. I do this for pump and Dexcom sites. Added bonus is that once the site is on, it’s not coming off even if I sweat a lot."

"New diagnosis - tips, tricks, and any helpful comments needed!","My best friend (26F), who is basically family to me, is getting discharged today after a scary admission with DKA and a new T1DM diagnosis. She is receiving education at the hospital and following up with her primary care, but as someone who is close to her I wanted to see what other people found helpful when they were newly diagnosed. 

I know right now she is very anxious about eating, and I'm especially looking for any helpful recipes or tips related to food. But honestly, anything helps. I want to be as prepared as possible to help her through this process!

The one thing that has been life saving for me, outside of you know, insulin in the first year was access to a CGM. I live alone and sharing my CGM data with a friend who could get into my home saved my life during a particularly bad low. 
Eating will feel really scary for a while, but it gets easier. It won’t feel like it, but you adapt and it just becomes part of your day. 
One thing I wish my endo would have told me is how much your menstrual cycle impacts your blood sugar. If your friend doesn’t already, tracking her cycle might be very helpful for her as her insulin requirements may fluctuate during and before her period. It’s different for everyone! 
Those first few weeks/months are so overwhelming and scary but it truly does get more manageable. Your friend will most certainly have days where she feels very defeated and it sounds like she already has a supportive listening ear available to her."

For a meal, try to find something you would want to eat too - don’t make her feel like flavor and good food is gone. If you wouldn’t eat it, why would she want to. Get a heat safe candy (won’t melt in heat or turn to stone in cold) for your car and where you live (hopefully it is one she likes) - so if she goes low you have something on hand. A big thing at first can be schedule - like eat lunch at noon and dinner at 6 (again if that is how her team does it - mine did). 

I would also treat it a little like the morning of a loss for her - she got a ‘for the rest of your life’ disease that affects almost every aspect of her life. So any advices for someone just lost their grandma… might also apply to her. Offer to go for walks with her and let her vent on how unfair life is."

I would add that the first weeks after a diagnosis are often traumatic, the first year has a very steep learning curve and after that it becomes this annoyance and time taker but otherwise she will be fine.

Often the best way you can be supportive is to do things with her, be patient if she needs more time to carb count a meal or snack, and be patient if she needs to sit and eat some carbs when you go for a walk.

There really isn't any ""diabetic diet"" it is a disease that can be managed in lots of different ways. People often hear diabetes and think about eliminating sugar, but that really isn't it.

A healthy supportive person will make sure she is responsible for the T1 and you are the awesome friend which you sound to be. Tell her to hang in there, it does get better."

He listens to me, addresses my concerns, let’s me be in charge of my care (that’s what I prefer) while supporting me, and best of all, he understands that Type 1 diabetes management is an art, not an exact science.

As for food, having recipes that give you the carbohydrate count is going to help her to learn how many carbs and fiber different foods contain, which will help her in the long run know how to account for food when giving short acting insulin. 

Also, don’t watch Steel Magnolias—Diabetes care is so different now and it’s only an accurate portrayal for that one diabetic, it’s nowhere near a universal depiction of type 1."
"New diagnosis - tips, tricks, and any helpful comments needed!","My best friend (26F), who is basically family to me, is getting discharged today after a scary admission with DKA and a new T1DM diagnosis. She is receiving education at the hospital and following up with her primary care, but as someone who is close to her I wanted to see what other people found helpful when they were newly diagnosed. 

I know right now she is very anxious about eating, and I'm especially looking for any helpful recipes or tips related to food. But honestly, anything helps. I want to be as prepared as possible to help her through this process!

(I am also doing my own research and looking for information on my own - but I thought this would be a good source in addition to that)

Thank you in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14jj45p/new_diagnosis_tips_tricks_and_any_helpful/,"Hey! I would love to send you a newly diagnosed guide for young adults by the college diabetes network, it’s about 80 pages and goes into detail about many things that are specific to what young adults go through, send me a DM if you’d like, it’s virtual! 

Other than that know that there’s a bit of grief involved, grieving the “before” time; before having to do injections and finger sticks and counting carbs and having to figure out insulin and everything involved. Some good low snacks to start that I’ve found that are portable are fruit snacks, go go squeeze regular apple apple flavor, and the small juice boxes. As well as, of course, glucose tablets. Learn how to administer glucagon and make sure she has that from either her PCP or endo once she’s set up with one! It gets easier with time, I promise, but at first it is definitely overwhelming and it’s fantastic you’re willing to support your friend. 

It sucks and seems so unfair and is sometimes exhausting but she will feel SO much better once her blood sugar is more controlled."

It’s their disability access, which is incredibly helpful as a diabetic (and probably for someone who is newly diagnosed).  The reason why DAS is so important, and the reason I gave them, is that you can have unexpected low blood sugars, and that can make it difficult to wait in long lines. 

Hers a god interview of DAS:  https://www.undercovertourist.com/blog/disneyland-disability-access-service-das/

Edit to add: sit down and check sugars often, you’ll likely be walking a lot, and I like using Gu packs for low sugars."

DAS is great, don't hesitate if you think it might help
2. You MAY need less basal insulin. Keep an eye on it as dropping a unit or so might be smart (I used 1 less unit of basal per day while on MDI in Disney)
3. Be very conservative with your bolus! With all the walking you do you are likely to need much less than normal. For reference I used maybe 5 units of bolus TOTAL over 5 days in Disney because we were simply walking so much I was burning glucose constantly. Your milage may vary on this, but it's something to take into consideration.

Best of luck!!"

This is a crude evaporative cooling. Below is information from Tandem about its temperature sensor:

""Tandem insulin pumps are the only pumps with a temperature sensor that will warn you when the temperature inside the pump has reached a level that may have compromised the insulin in the cartridge.  
Here are some key points about this feature:  
If your pump detects a temperature outside of the normal operating range – below 35˚F (2˚C) or above 113˚F (45˚C) – the Temperature Alarm occurs, protecting you from continuing to deliver insulin that may have lost its potency.  
The alarm will sound and insulin delivery will be stopped. At this point, please consult your insulin manufacturer for advice.  
When the alarm sounds, the pump needs to be removed from the heat source before insulin delivery can be resumed. You should replace the cartridge and insulin as soon as possible.  
This feature was designed to protect you from receiving affected insulin. Your Tandem pump hardware has been tested to operate in a wide range of temperatures from -4°F to 140°F so even when the temperature alarm is triggered, your pump is not in danger.""

Job denials?,"Military is out, any others? Ie firefighter, police etc?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14j2svc/job_denials/,"UK Type 1 for 48 yrs over here 👋🏼

I was diagnosed at the age of 4 after a case of rubella. It took my poor mum nearly 6 months to get a doctor to listen to her that I had more than flu, tummy upset, some sort of virus. It actually took me me falling into a coma at home; when the paramedic walked in the room he said has she been taking her insulin; he recognised the pear drops smell immediately. Once in hospital & in intensive care my parents were told to say their goodbyes as I wouldn’t survive. I left the hospital 2 months later with zero complications. 

Yet my parents were still told I wouldn’t survive into double digits & if I did I would be blind with severe organ failure. Then when I did survive that long it became you’ll never reach adulthood or have children. 

So it gives me enormous pleasure to be sat here 48 yrs later with no complications, 4 fit & healthy adult sons & having completed several marathons & ultras, 3 peaks challenge done, skydived & scuba dived & had a career as a theatre sister. Things I’ve probably done because I was always told I wouldn’t ever be able to by the professionals. But my parents were always you can do anything you want; just take a little more time planning but still doable. And all of this with no tech! 

My point is your little one is only 4 & newly diagnosed so I suspect you’re overthinking everything right now. In a way you’re thinking diabetes now controls his life. It doesn’t. He (or rather you at this age) control it. Just enjoy him being a child & let the future him plan his career. Cross that bridge when he gets to it. For now let him eat the damn ice cream & cakes; remember the only food diabetics can’t eat is anything with poison in it!"

I think armed services are the only thing still 100% forbidden to a well controlled T1. Even if there is still something that hasn't been done, your son could be the first if it is important enough to him. We recently had the 1st US commercial pilot (probably 5 years ago now) - there is a first for everything!!! Teach your child not to find excuses why something can't be done but to find ways to do it safely. Diabetes makes many things more challenging, but it also makes us better able to plan for success and capable of problem solving in general. 

Your son can be ANYTHING he wants to be and do ANYTHING he wants to do. Make sure you believe it and live it, and he can too!!!"

I’d expect this to be 5-10 years out still, considering they still need to prep, start, run, and evaluate a large group of participants across numerous countries, then if effective, ramp up production, marketing, pricing, insurance evaluations, etc. Oh, and wait for FDA approval…

Blood glucose rapidly decreasing during exercise,"Ive been diagnosed with T1D about 18 months ago and only started to take it fully seriously in the past month or so.

What is your basal to bolus ratio? Your basal might be too high and becomes a lot more effective when active. If you’re coming off honeymoon (which sounds like you are) you have probably been coasting on your basal being too high which is why you only need a few units for meals. Try getting basal/bolus daily closer to 50/50. Are you seeing and endocrinologist? They’re super helpful in getting you straightened out coming out of honeymoon.

Honeymoon means sometimes your pancreas works. A working pancreas would stop pushing insulin when you were headed low.

In people who are not injecting insulin, when you exercise, your body drops its insulin levels to VERY low amounts (pancreas-produced insulin sticks around for minutes in the system, so once the pancreas reduces insulin levels, the body is reacting in minutes). When insulin levels drop, glucagon hormone levels rise and glucagon tells your liver to release its stored sugars. Additionally, the body might shift to fats for fuel as well. These things allow a person's blood sugar to remain fairly stable.

If you are injecting insulin, your body can't do this for you. Rapid acting insulin lasts in the body for 5 hours and the basal is on the order of a day. To exercise effectively (or just be active), you (usually) need your insulin levels to be low. There are plenty of caveats and everyone's body works differently, so the exact advice could vary, but probably what you should do is reduce basal, take more fast acting around meals when planning to be sedentary for the next 3 hours, and then manipulate either the amount of fast acting or skip it entirely when near a time you plan to exercise. 

Your starting blood sugar level is only a small benefit when you think about it. At 5 liters of blood, 180 mg/dL is 9 grams of sugar in your blood stream. That's 45 calories worth of sugar. Let's say walking is 8 calories per minute. Even if your body was primed to only take half that from sugar, you've still got less than 10 minutes before you've burned down to low blood sugar. So, the only solutions are to eat carbs or reduce insulin. At higher activity levels, reduced insulin is a must as your body can only absorb so many carbohydrates per hour.

Good luck, it's a hard thing to manage, but it's worth it."

You have to decide:

1. Lower basal drastically, like down to 0 or close to it, and then raise your fast acting for meals. This is the best solution if you don’t go on a pump and want to be active with walking/running. Note: As honeymoon ends, your basal will be a moving target and you will slowly have to increase. Doctors cant help much with these, best if you do it yourself. My endo recommends raising or lowering basal 1 unit at a time, wait 3 days, then repeat. In reality i sometimes raise or lower it 1-3 units and it depends on a number of factors. How much protein i ate that day is the biggest one, how much i excercised is another. 
2. Make sure you have a cgm (sounds like you do) and carry snacks everywhere you go and have them near you at night and correct. Note: You will have to do this anyways, but with the high basal to fast acting rate you are describing, you will have to do it a lot more."

I experimented with a good few times back in highschool as a student athlete and lives a pretty balanced active lifestyle with somewhat a decent bg control

Depending on the workout your bg can react differently. In my experience, high cardio always leads to sharp drops so I need to eat more before, heavy weight training doesn't drop as much so I either eat less or take in more insulin. 

What I found out tho was no matter what exercise, as long as you sweat quite a bit, you need food and insulin. I recommend experimenting with some snacks eaten 10-30mins before exercise with very small amounts of insulin and work from there.

He's referring to the fact you generally ALWAYS need insulin to cover carbohydrate no matter the scenario.   
IF you don't, you're probably in a ""Honeymoon"" Phase where your body is still producing some insulin (covering small meals like 10-15g of carbohydrate)   
I would assume your background insulin is too high and covering your small meals carbs just enough (with the help of your somewhat still working pancreas) And when you go on a walk it just drops your BG (happened to me during my Honeymoon

We should be tracking how much carbs you're taking when you eat and then check your blood glucose level to see what you're at.
For example:
For breakfast I ate 25 carbs.   I checked my blood sugar before I ate and it was 120.   2 hours after I ate it was 140.     I did not take any insulin.    

Basically you should be tracking every time you eat what your blood sugar is before and a couple hours after.     If you're maintaining a blood sugar of between 90 to 120,
And your heating carbs and you're not taking any fast acting insulin, then you're probably on what they call honeymoon phase.
That means your body is still producing insulin..... If you notice when you eat a meal that has over 20 carbs and your blood sugar is say 120 before you eat and then 2 hours later it's 180,   then you should be taking her fast acting insulin to try to keep your level around 120.    Everyone's insulin dose per carb ratio is different.
For example ours is 1 unit of insulin for every 10 carbs for the fast acting.    
You should really seek out an endocrinologist.... Unfortunately that is a must otherwise you can end up just destroying all your organs or going into hypoglycemia and killing yourself."

I can speak for my own experience when I was first diagnosed, I'd go for walks after dinner almost every day with my wife and went low almost every time. I'm an amateur endurance athlete, so it was definitely not ""significant"" exercise for me. That was obviously with meal bolus onboard, but a heavy basal dose could do it, too.

So for the past 2-3 days I’ve been thinking to myself maybe I left or leaving the honeymoon phase I blame myself and I feel like everyone failed me and I failed myself so I get these thoughts if I can’t figure out how much insulin to cover for what I’m eating now how am I going to live with this for the rest of my life

Really, get a new Endo first thing when business opens. Your doc should be willing to provide you a sample pack if you desperately need it due to financial/insurance issues. And if your family is really that unhelpful/detrimental, report them or move away (whichever fits with your age)."

If you’re somewhat close to being out on your own, it might not be worth the trouble of trying to educate them. If you know you’re going to be sort under their thumb for a good while longer, it will be worth the trouble. Because having them treat you and your diabetes like this is untenable. You deserve the best shot at having a healthy outlook on your own life, and their behavior can be damaging. 

Is it possible for you to see your doctor again? Tell them that you think you need to start using more insulin but don’t know how. And also tell them about how your parents are acting…your parents need to understand that your diabetes was NOT your fault. They also need to understand that it is burden enough, and they are adding to that by making your insulin purchases such a big ordeal. Sometimes hearing that from a doctor or other professional is the only thing that will change minds. They might not hear it coming from you, sadly."

I have 4 autoimmune diseases myself as well.

It’s a pain in the ass, truly, but not uncommon. They say that about 25% of people with one autoimmune condition will develop at least one more. Probably because of a combination of the genetic and environmental factors. 

There are lots of genes that appear to be linked to autoimmunity. The conventional thinking is that having some of these genes AND experiencing a trigger under the right conditions can tip our immune systems toward attacking our own cells. Like, you have a gene and you’re vitamin d deficient and you have a bad bout with a virus, and then your immune system drops the basket a bit - and that can mean a single AI disease or multiple. 

But none of this is proven yet. We need a lot more science to truly understand what’s happening."

However, it's important to address any potential health concerns and get proper testing done to get the necessary treatment if needed. 
Regarding your question, there is limited research on COVID triggering other autoimmune conditions in individuals who were already diagnosed with T1. However, autoimmune conditions can sometimes coexist, and it's possible that the COVID infection could have triggered the onset of the lupus symptoms. I would recommend discussing this possibility with your healthcare provider and getting the appropriate testing done to rule out or confirm a lupus diagnosis. 
In the meantime, it's important to focus on taking care of your health by engaging in regular physical activity that is appropriate for your health status, following a healthy and balanced diet, and getting enough restorative sleep. Natural remedies, like stress reduction techniques and natural supplements, can also be helpful in managing autoimmune symptoms. 
If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to DM me. Take care and stay safe."

If you head down you can eat. High you cannot fix without insulin and time. You are behind on the time right now. Waiting is not going to help.

It is not a miracle help, but drinking extra water is a good idea. If you go very high, you may have to check for ketones and correct (per your doc). But you just ate so hopefully you can turn this around without ketones.

Just remember that your pump (if that is how you redose) will think your insulin in board is super high, so you cannot use the pump math until all that goes away (say 3 to 4 hours).

Be safe, check your BGs often.

Everyone has had this happen at least once."

"Omnipod 5 horrors - stubborn unexplained lows, insulin dispensed despite deactivation, absorption issues?","
(Crossposting from /r/Omnipod)

Parent of t1d kiddo diagnosed 2 months back. Just got him started with Omnipod 5 2 days back after transitioning from MDI and having nothing but issues. Haven’t gotten much help from the oncall nurse or Omnipod support except “try changing your pod” so hoping somebody here can help. 

This is what happened yesterday:

1. He had a bolus (1.05 correction plus 0.3 carbs) of 1.35 units at 4.20pm. IOB after bolus was 1.6 units. BG 281. He ate the 10g of carbs that we bolused for.
2. Automated basal was 0.05 units at 4:55pm.
3. From 4:50-5:48pm right around this basal, his BG crashed from 252 to 51. We gave the carbs to thwart the drop starting at BG 90 but by the time we had turned it around it had dropped to BG 51 and we had given 3 times the usual amount of carbs that we need for lows (spread over 3 installments).
4. CGM readings were cross checked with finger prick 2 times 15 minutes apart and they matched.

Q1: why such a stubborn low, despite the IOB at 281 being only 1.6 and eating the 10g carbs we bolused for? The 1.3 units of correction in this dose should have only brought his BG down by 130-150 points to BG 130. His correction factor and insulin to carb ratio in the pump were already a bit more conservative than what we have been using for MDI. And time of action of insulin setting is a conservative 4 hours instead of the 3 hours we typically thought of during MDI.


Back to the timeline:
5. Around 5:45pm I successfully put the pump in manual mode. Then I tried to pause insulin, but the PDM said error talking to the pump. Retried again with the same result. Then PDM screen stopped responding for a couple seconds during which I may have inadvertently tapped on it. Anyway, the PDM then said the pump had been deactivated.
6. Our treatment of the 51 only spiked BG to 110 despite so many carbs. From 5:45-9pm this kept dropping back down and spiking a little as we kept treating it with the usual 12g of carbs. Total 3 times.

Q2: Were these repeated drops a continuation of the stubborn low that took us to 51, or was it due to the pump continuing to inject insulin despite supposedly being deactivated? Even if it did inject insulin I’d assume the small basal dose shouldn’t have caused this much crashing.


7.  9:30-10:30pm BG stabilized and spiked as expected after his dinner.
8. 10:30pm Pod physically removed from his tummy. No beeping when it was removed, perhaps suggesting that deactivation went through at some point? 
9. 10:45pm - Gave him Lantus (same dose as during MDI) and he has been pump free since last night.


Would greatly appreciate some help here, I realize this is a long post…I’m worried that just trying out a new pod will not prevent this from recurring. We can loosen the isf and carb ratio in the pump but that doesn’t seem promising because it’s already more conservative than what we used during MDI. And in the 24 hours preceding this episode his BG has been fine.

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14iv2qn/omnipod_5_horrors_stubborn_unexplained_lows/,"Sounds like you're suffering from the honeymoon phase and increased insulin sensitivity.

No I’ve not been offered anything at all yet. He did completely rule out closed loop though but tbh after 48yrs of sticking needles in myself I’ll take anything!! 

It was my annual review and he’s was banging on about how well I’m doing blah blah. Then got onto my overnight lows & why I hadn’t scanned to check when the alarms went off; I explained they don’t always go off (Libre this is) and besides I sleep like the dead. Then he brought up the sudden rise around 4/5am. So either increasing the basal dose would cause more hypos & decreasing would cause higher sugars in the morning. 

I’ve only been saying this for the last few years but hey what do I know 🤦🏻‍♀️ and that when he brought up pumps, asked me if it was something I’d like to consider I said yes & he said he’d refer me. He said someone will be on touch but if I’d not heard anything in 2 months to give his secretary a ring to chase it up. 


So I don’t know whether I’m waiting for the funding team or someone to discuss possible pumps options or someone to go through it all & see if it’s what I really want 🤷🏻‍♀️"

Burn Out and Advice,"I’ve never posted on here before, but I’m 18 and from the Uk. I was diagnosed as a diabetic aged 12 and managing it throughout my teenage years was physically ok but mentally draining. 

Fast forward to now, and I feel I might be in a ‘burn out’. My blood sugar has been high for ages and trying to juggle diabetes, a new job, studying, driving lessons etc has been hard. 

I feel so stressed and I’m finding it difficult to bring my readings down. Half of me is tired and wants to ignore my diabetes but the other half is so frightened - I know all the complications that could come from high blood sugar and it’s scares me all the time. 

I’m saying today is a new day and I’ve got to start fresh and not get complacent, ie guess how much insulin to take and work it out properly as I don’t want to jeopardise my health anymore. 

I know many others have probably felt similar in the past, as type 1 diabetes tends to have seriously negative effects on a persons mental health. Does anyone have any tips or advice as sometimes it can be quite isolating ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14ic3ku/burn_out_and_advice/,"I struggle with burnout too. I haven't found an easy solution. When trying to get my sugars down I make my days as much the same as I can for a few weeks - it makes it easier for me to fix whatever is off in my insulin amounts. 

To help with the mental load during those weeks I give myself permission to let go of something else. When I was living by myself I'd buy paper plates for those weeks so I didn't have to do dishes. Then I would use that time I saved for self care.

Try and find someone to vent to - a support group, therapist or a good friend. I get a lot of comfort by trading war stories with a buddy who has Celiac - just someone who understands chronic disease management sucks - doesn't have to be a diabetic.

Finally if I'm really burnt out I push my Endo for new technology. I don't know why but an upgrade in pump or CGM really helps me be excited about looking at my numbers. And I get to pick out new accessories - like new patches in fun prints or switch to a different color pump case. This works as a weird kind of retail therapy for me.

Good luck!"

When I was your age home glucose testing did not exist nor did the variety of insulins or A1c. The data available today can contribute to ""analysis paralysis"" with lots of stress and anxiety. Moreover, the ""juggle"" you describe also creates stress and anxiety for anyone (even if they are not T1D). Lastly, your body is still maturing and balancing insulin, food, and physical activity is a moving target.

Stress and anxiety, as no doubt you've observed, elevate blood glucose. Even at my age, meeting tight deadlines, planning a long trip, etc., will elevate blood glucose for days while working toward the deadline. It's also the only time I experience the dawn effect, but since I know how my body responds I make insulin adjustments to keep it under control.

What to do? 1) If you don't already have a sensor and pump try to get them 2) begin meals with fiber foods eg., salad... (only use vinegar and 1 tsp of oil for dressing) followed by proteins and carbs as this will blunt the meal glucose rise;  prepare your own meals and snacks at home with known ingredients; avoid rich, refined, and processed \[non\] foods as they'll cause the rollercoaster 3) remain physically active (daily if possible) and walk, hike, ride a bike... in nature if possible 4) Mediate and reflect to reduce the stress and anxiety by taking yourself into account at the end of each day and see on what can be done better tomorrow. Whether or not you have the ""diabetic doldrums"" listen to good tunes to Shake It Off https://youtu.be/8xG7mH8i-WE

I feel so stressed and I’m finding it difficult to bring my readings down. Half of me is tired and wants to ignore my diabetes but the other half is so frightened - I know all the complications that could come from high blood sugar and it’s scares me all the time. 

I’m saying today is a new day and I’ve got to start fresh and not get complacent, ie guess how much insulin to take and work it out properly as I don’t want to jeopardise my health anymore. 

I know many others have probably felt similar in the past, as type 1 diabetes tends to have seriously negative effects on a persons mental health. Does anyone have any tips or advice as sometimes it can be quite isolating ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14ic3ku/burn_out_and_advice/,"I first found a REAL diabetes doctor who knows much more about treatments and trends than any general practitioner, and put my worrying mind to rest while lobbying for the best devices. I think my devices contribute to my attitude and mental outlook, so much better than struggling daily with injections and meters! I also find comfort reading historical articles of how hopeless diabetes used to be, and current ones about new technologies and treatments. The disease is absolutely awful, but our attitude about it doesn't have to be."

They’re only on Phase 1/2 trials. They have a very, very long way to go to get to FDA, and the FDA may have issues with the risk-benefit of the treatment (gaining insulin production at the expense of an immune system).

I really wouldn’t count on this being some big “miracle” right around the corner…and I say this as a former Vertex employee."

But simply knowing that treatment is coming and to start hearing the stories of people that no longer need to inject insulin and aren’t on immune suppressants will be a massive uplift for all t1ds. Knowing their is a finish line in sight hopefully encourages people to stay as healthy as possible until they can be next in line."

For example, if I order pizza, I give insulin when it arrives because pizza takes some time to break down (stupid bread). But because pizza/bread is carb loaded, I give small amounts of insulin every hour afterwards for about the next 3-4 hours depending on how much I eat. If it’s pasta, I will do the same, again bread, pasta takes longer to break down. If I have a salad I’ll give like 5-10 minutes early. If I have soup or something that will break down quicker in my body, then I give 15-20 minutes early. Hopefully this helps, each of us diabetics are different but all technically work the same. so you just gotta figure out how your body likes to break down and absorb carbs/sugars. And how much insulin you need. Trail and error. Good luck!"

So, good news/bad news.  Good news is 15 minutes is just a number. There's no magic that 16 minutes and you'll die of a low. The bad news is 15 mintues is just a number and you could go low at 10, who knows, right?

As for what I do.

I bolus 4 units right when I sit down. That's probably about half to 3/4 of what I'll need for the meal. Once I pick the meal and order, I'll decide how much additional to take. I usually take the additional bolus right when I order, but depending on trends and various stuff at the place, I sometimes wait and take it when the food arrives or sometime between.

So many places that are long waits for food do chips or bread, so that cuts the risk down hugely as even a single piece of bread can cover you for a long time. But, if the food is taking a long time, I have glucose tabs in my pocket enough to cover me for the bolus, but honestly, you only need to ""delay"" until the food arrives, so you'd probably be able to get away with just 2 tabs to cover waiting for like an hour. 

This said - I have NEVER in all my years of doing this strategy needed to eat my glucose tabs (unless I was headed low before I walked in the restaurant anyways). While sitting down and doing nothing, I find insulin to be very slow. (Add almost any amount of walking around and that story changes.)"

In a restaurant you're never more than 30 seconds away from a sugar based drink,  heavily processed white bread or shittons of pure refined sugar. Outside of a hospital restaurants are literally the safest place to prebolus. 

2. You don't have to prebolus the entire volume at once. I prebolus a third of my guesstimate when I order. If the order takes more than 15 minutes I'll eat a bit of bread/ sip a bit of soda and set another third and then add a unit or two when the food comes based on how much I ate/drank before."

"Traveling out of country for the first time, any tips?","Hi, Canadian here traveling to the US for the first time with t1. I’ll be leaving about a month from now for about 2 weeks.

Also keep it on your person (do not check the bag with your supplies) in case they loose your luggage!! Safe travels!

- take double what you think you’ll need.

- pack a weeks worth in your travel on

- put the rest in your checked baggage if flying (it does NOT freeze). Then if you get your checked bags stolen - as has happened to me - you have back up

- if you’re travelling with a friend, ask them to carry some

- take a letter from your doctor and back up prescriptions just incase

- apply for the tga pass if travelling in America

- travelling can do whacky/weird things to your bgl and insulin requirements

- travel insurance. If you can’t afford it, you can’t afford to travel

- have a brilliant trip!"

Take a prescription with you to “prove” you require the drug and try to keep it cool and don’t leave it in a hotel fridge…. That one sucks!!

Bring as much as you need x 2.  But if you lose/run out - the US is by far the worst country in the developed world to solve that problem.  Anywhere else in canada or europe - the pharmacist will just sell you more insulin over the counter.  The US  it is not the case.  I just had this problem in Florida - and it took 4 pharmacies and lots of talking g to get old school needle style insulin- at a high cost.  Apparantly - this subreddit told me after that if you ever run out of supplies in the US - Walmart is by far the best place to go.

I think my Dexcom needle is stuck in my arm,"I bumped against a sink at work today and it knocked my Dexcom loose.

If you call dexcom or your doctors they’ll likely tell you to go to a&e. For me I could definitely feel the sensor (the metal bendy thing is actually the sensor and not a needle - important distinction when you call Dexcom or speak to your doctors as it’s not as serious as it would be if the needle itself had broken off and was stuck in your arm after insertion). 

When it happened to me I could definitely feel the sensor under my skin and the little bump that is usually there was much larger. The sensor feels quite different than just a skin bump. But if you’re not certain it’s probably best to get it x-rayed to check. 

In my experience you have two options: 
- go to a&e immediately, have it scanned and when they’ll see where it is they make a decision whether you need surgery or a general doctor can try to cut it out. 
- Or you wait a few hours and see if the bump disappears. I had a second scare where I wasn’t sure if the sensor was stuck again or not. I ended up just waiting and the bump disappeared, I couldn’t feel anything after an hour. The first time it happened the bump did not disappear - it was also a very significant bump and felt very different - so I decided it was probably fine. But be aware that if you’re uncertain at all it is definitely better to just get it checked out. My doctors told me it is not worth the risk. So up to you.

And lastly just to reassure you - if the sensor is stuck in your arm and they have to cut it out, it’s not too bad. Definitely not fun at the time but it heals fairly quickly (I think I couldn’t take a shower for 5 days without covering it up because it needed to be glued so you have to be careful not to dissolve the glue. But after those 5 days it was fine and now I only have a tiny little scar left that’s not even visible unless you point it out to someone)."

i called dexcom who said that i should see a doctor. i went to see my gp (uk), they felt it in my arm and said that it wasn’t likely to be an issue due to its position. the needle eventually disappears as it’s made of a biodegradable material apparently. 
they said to keep an eye on it and to come straight in if i started having twinges/pain in that area. stopped using sensors on that arm for a month or two and have had no issues since. best of luck!"
I think my Dexcom needle is stuck in my arm,"I bumped against a sink at work today and it knocked my Dexcom loose. I checked it when I got home and the transmitter was loose, so I took the entire thing off to replace it. When I peeled it, though, I didn't find the needle part that goes under the skin. I took the entire sticker off and there was no needle anywhere. It'd been ripped off the sticker itself. I have a bump where the injection sight was, but I can't feel if the needle is still under my skin or not. I can't tell if it fell off while taking off the sticker, or when it was bumped at work, or if it's still embedded in my skin.

My Dexcom was located on my right upper arm, behind my shoulder, if this is important.

The bump I feel is small. There's usually a bump when I remove them because of the blood drop clotting in the injection sight. However, I can't tell if this bump is from the application of my Dexcom or the needle. What should I do? If it's still embedded in my arm, should I seek medical attention, or would my body push it out naturally?

Good news is that the wire is radio opaque and will show up just fine on x-ray. 

It isn't an emergency or anything, so a primary care visit for an x-ray order and antibiotic (if needed) is a good plan."

The bump I feel is small. There's usually a bump when I remove them because of the blood drop clotting in the injection sight. However, I can't tell if this bump is from the application of my Dexcom or the needle. What should I do? If it's still embedded in my arm, should I seek medical attention, or would my body push it out naturally?

(Edit)
I called Dexcom right as I posted this. They said not to mess with the area and that my body will push it out eventually. Otherwise, if I see any signs of infection, to call them and call my doctor. They are sending me a free sensor replacement for my troubles as well.

I will say the graphs don’t look as smooth (more jumpy i guess?) but every time i’ve finger pricked it’s been accurate. 

So far it’s a big yes for me cause when i used G6 there were some sensors that just did not want to stay accurate at all. I am sure there will be some with the G7 too, but I honestly don’t notice that much of a difference in accuracy or how it works, and all the other differences like size (don’t even notice it and doesn’t get caught on my clothes), warm up time (30 min or less? yes pls!), 12 hr grace period (amazing), these are BIG pros for me!

There’s the occasional signal loss but it’s for only like 10-15 minutes and it hasn’t happens more than a few times. The g6 was worse and I’d lose connectivity for an hour or more. Overall I’d say I’m pretty satisfied."

Op5 will support it summer 2024 tentatively for example.

The g7 receiver def works more reliably than the phone app as far as signal and connectivity are concerned. Smaller size, smaller applicator (lesser trash), 12 hour extension, no hassle with changing transmitter, smaller warm up and ability to pair second sensor before first expires are all positives.

G7 accuracy maybe more than g6 on paper, but I’ve had g6 and g7 behave about the same. There are times when the readings are way off compared to fsbg…calibration doesn’t really help either imo."

I use a t:slim, Dexcom G6, with iPhone/AppleWatch. This combo, for me, is the closest thing to a cure until there is one. I keep my t:slim in a ""leather"" belt holster and only about an inch of tubing is exposed while the rest is safely tucked behind belt into shorts/trousers. I've never once had a tubing snag since the outset because the tubing is never exposed. I'm physically active and keep both infusion and sensor going outward from abdomen and onto my sides as far as I can comfortably reach. Infusion and sensor sites are cleansed before and after with hydrogen peroxide (isopropyl alcohol dehydrates skin). After cleansing, used infusion sites are sealed with a small hydrocolloid bandage (left in place for at least 5 days). So far, I have not developed any scar tissue but I'm under excellent control and physically active.

My 4.5yo suddenly started peeing her pants. She was fully potty trained early (around 2.5yo), so this has nothing to do with her not being ready.

I am positive that this is not attention seeking and nothing that she can help, there is something wrong.
We have taken urinal tests to our family doctor and they are clean, her bowels have also been checked and they are also fine... and now she is showing other symptoms, like thirstyness, extreme hunger (especially in the morning), her stomach hurts.... and when I picked her up from daycare today she was so tired that she couldn't walk to the car, was really slow and like she was about to fall asleep in the middle of the playground, witch is very much unlike her (and the teacher said she has been unlike her self all after noon)... after eating at home she was the happiest most energetic kid on the block again. I took her into the only clinic open here and the did a finger blood test for diabetes, and it turned out normal... so my question is, could this be diabetes even if the finger test was normal?

In my case I showed high blood sugar once but all the other times for 3 years everything was normal.  Then my pancreas  just decided to quit 100 percent. That when I was actually diagnosed.  Because the symptoms showed themselves as a classic diabetic.  There are many studies now that t1d does not happen suddenly it can come on gradually causing all these symptoms that cannot be diagnosed without real blood testing. Also a cgm can help see how blood sugars are throughout the day.  Good luck.  I hope she is just having pee accidents as I do not wish this disease on anyone.

Go to the pharmacy today and get a glucometer and start testing and recording her BG. First thing in the morning and 2 hrs post eating. You can google to see what normal BG range is. Because a finger prick is a snapshot it doesn’t mean much on its own and you need to see the overall pattern. If you see high numbers, go to the ER, don’t wait for a doctor’s appointment. 

If you genuinely feel it’s T1D, go NOW to get that glucometer. It’s not something to “wait and see” with. My son was diagnosed 1.5 years ago at 7 years old. He was peeing/drinking CONSTANTLY. He was not in DKA at diagnosis and other than the urination and increased appetite he seemed like a perfectly healthy kid. He tested high on a glucometer and I brought him to the ER where he bounced in looking like the healthiest kid in the world. They fast tracked him at the ER when they saw his BG levels and we left the ER 4 hours later with a life altering diagnosis. I tell you this to emphasize- DON’T WAIT."

It has been weeks of her peeing her pants every day, often a day. She does not seem to feel that she needs to go, until the minute she has to go. We of course take her to the toilet and tell her to go regularly, but still she is having accidents both at home and in daycare. I am positive that this is not attention seeking and nothing that she can help, there is something wrong.
We have taken urinal tests to our family doctor and they are clean, her bowels have also been checked and they are also fine... and now she is showing other symptoms, like thirstyness, extreme hunger (especially in the morning), her stomach hurts.... and when I picked her up from daycare today she was so tired that she couldn't walk to the car, was really slow and like she was about to fall asleep in the middle of the playground, witch is very much unlike her (and the teacher said she has been unlike her self all after noon)... after eating at home she was the happiest most energetic kid on the block again. I took her into the only clinic open here and the did a finger blood test for diabetes, and it turned out normal... so my question is, could this be diabetes even if the finger test was normal?

You're going to want more blood work. 

Get a fasted blood test. Blood sugar should be 4.7 to 5ish ( For an adult, at least.  I'm not certain for a child,  but I think their fasted bg is a little lower than that.)

You will want to them to measure HbA1C, too. This is a measurement of average blood sugars over a 3ish month period."

When we switch we wipe down the new area and the area we remove from with alcohol wipes just to be sure since it’s an open wound. 

We have never had any issues with infection and by the time we need to switch again the area is pretty much healed up. We lotion the backs of his arms after showers as well so idk if that helps keep the skin moisturized so it can heal better?"

Sometimes I feel the numbness in my legs too if I am walking. I also get this specific vague taste in my mouth. 

I found the light-headedness is very similar to coming up on psychedelics, every time I did them I would always be checking my blood sugars just in case haha. They would be perfectly fine, but the feeling is so similar. 

Sometimes I can also notice my brains capacity to process information gets limited. I remember once I was watching a movie at the cinema and had no clue what was going on, I felt so dumb. Something about sitting still in the dark made me not notice my sugars dropping, but the moment I walked out I was like ""aah""

BTW I have absolutely no high blood sugar awareness. Don't feel anything! A blessing and a curse, lol"

I never used to get it this bad, but in the last couple years I have just layed there, exhausted for a hour or even more after bringing myself back up, I am 30yrs old and I dont think age really has much to do with it, at least not this much. It is odd because I think I've had like 5-10 diabetic seizures that were all in my first years when I still had no idea or firm plan on how to deal, and my blood sugar drops even lower than ever before now. My seizures are 99% epileptic, I was diagnosed a couple years ago, and none of that is quite as debilitating as low blood sugar can apparently be, but I figure epilepsy adds a lot to all that."

Has anyone here tried intermittent fasting?

I was able to bring down my A1C back to the normal range by not eating breakfast /carbohydrates and eliminating sugar. 

I admit it’s hard and I get sugar cravings but so far I am able to wait until lunch time to eat.

However, I still get fatigued, and stay thirsty.

When I wake up I see what looks like a transparent yellow / gray spider walking on the ceiling lol for a few minutes.

I hope and pray I can keep myself from getting diabetes. It scares me to think I could lose a foot or go into a coma.

Wishing everyone here good health!"

Breakfast- Here lately I have been making two waffles with this protein pancake mix I’ve found at Aldi and Dollar Tree.

I use sugar free syrup that is pretty economical from Aldi or Amazon.

I put blueberries in the syrup and and warm it in the microwave.

This may not be ideal but it feels me up.

Or, sometime I eat Jimmy Dean biscuits or bagel with sausage that you can get premade at the store in the frozen section.

Dinner - I usually make a meat and vegetables try to fill up with as much protein, so I don’t feel too hungry afterwards.

I have also found skinny bagels at Aldi and I use that with a hamburger, eggs, cream cheese, etc.

It’s hard because I love dessert.

I do cheat (I know I shouldn’t), when I I still feel hungry by eating skinny popcorn, or the kettle flavored popcorn from Costco. I am trying to ween myself down to just a cup of that.

I am also reading books about diet.

One is called Eat to Beat Disease by Dr. William Li.

He’s on YouTube and has cured tons of people with all kinds of diseases by helping them modify their diet.

I am bipolar too, so have another book by Dr. Amen called the Amen Solution. 

This book is about “the brain healthy way to get thinner, smarter and happier”. He’s on YouTube too.

I try to watch as many of these videos about health, bipolar, anxiety, etc. because they are very helpful.

I hope that these suggestions/books may help everyone on this thread learn to control their diabetes.

Best!"

I haven't had any unawareness.

I will say that stricter control and running closer to the baseline can mildly desensitise you .

What I mean is that I am extremely functional with low blood sugar. It feels like my body and brain have adapted to it. 

I can pretty readily guesstimate how low I am from the different indicators though.

Anywhere below 5 and I can notice it."

How do you feel when you're low?,"I find it fascinating to hear how different people feel the effects of low blood sugar. For example, when my dad gets low he completely changes. He gets very shaky, becomes uncooperative and is basically in denial that anything is wrong. He has to be force-fed sugar sometimes lol.

If I get to low 50s-40s, I sweat a lot, hear loud static/ringing in my ears, and will sometimes see white squiggly lines in front of my eyes.

I suspect that what you REALLY want though is a custom watchface displaying realtime CGM data, and not just the alerts.   

If thats the case, how you want to use it is the important question.  

Just Google ""dexcom cgm custom watchface samsung watch/Garmin watch/whatever brand” and find videos of how it looks."

Long acting + insulin pump?,"Has anyone tried using their long acting insulin with an insulin pump?

And it's masking the root cause of your issues with the pump. Is it more likely that your basal rates on the pump are just too low? You're effectively supplementing your basal rate on the pump with more injected insulin. Which points to insufficient basal delivery from the pump.

Again this was an old minimed pump (2010?) WITH NO BASAL FAST ACTING INSULIN. 
Using both at once seems really dangerous. ( basal fast acting + long acting ). 

The pumps now are really geared to total control w fast acting. You may need to swap fast acting insulins and try maybe Humalog instead of Novolog or vice versa. They have different times that they stay active in your body and can make a difference with control. 

Medication adjustments, especially with drugs like insulin, really need to be overseen by a doctor.

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14gqirt,"First off, really sorry you're dealing with all that custody stuff on top of D, which is a stressful enough circumstance as is.

I'm not a lawyer, nor a doctor, but have been t1 for 17+ years and seeing a 14 day avg of 500+ is worrisome, even if just a few readings were that... y'all must get intervention and medical case mediation/management for their care in the other household. I am VERY concerned that they're sabotaging your management by switching CGM devices - was this malicious to stop you from being able to monitor the data?--get a third party to investigate assuming you are unable to do so yourself given the arrangement. I would also confirm that child did indeed wear CGM the full time and find a way that the info be shared with you and child's medical team ASAP. 

Child is safe and stable with you now thank goodness, but extended periods of blood sugar that high are dangerous.

I am interpreting from the info provided that the glucometer is only used to verify the readings on CGM - can you see each and every reading on the meter? Or does it only provide the 14/30 day avg? If it's only the average, maybe they only used the meter once given that it doesn't show ""14d avg of X# of readings""... but I dunno.......

RE: the specific questions you asked:

Q1: Is this a regular happening with your child? Is this characteristic of the early stages of diagnosis?  
A1: Getting carb counts & insulin doses right at any stage of diabetes is tricky - it's a complex ""it depends"" based on a lot of factors, many of which we have no ability to measure their precise impacts on blood glucose (ie cortisol, hydration, sleep). In early stages of t1, most have a ""honeymoon phase"" where pancreas is still cranking out some insulin sometimes, and makes for a challenging time to find a sense of regularity in dosing. Take notes. Stay vigilant about carb counting and insulin dosing. Work with endo team to ensure proper insulin:carb ratio, basal, and correction factor(insulin sensitivity factor). It may benefit y'all, especially given the shared custody arrangement, to get kiddo on an omnipod5.  
Anecdotally, if blood sugar is elevated for an extended period of time, it takes some time to get back to ""more stable"" levels. I don't have a research study to point to, but my CDCES has mentioned this to me when I've had some stubborn highs that seemingly needed a lot more insulin than ""normal"" to get back in range after a period of higher than ""normal"" days. Plus what you mentioned in another comment about time zone & elevation change - bravo to you for getting back to a more manageable range so quickly.

Q2: Does this mean that it's absolutely unmanaged when in their other household?  
A2: Potentially. As mentioned above, unless you can go back and see each measurement, it's really really hard to say. I'm not familiar with this screen on glucometer, but it will behove you to invest in a meter that you can see reading by reading. See what test strips your insurance covers then go from there. You need that CGM data to know the answer to this for certain, unless you can see each individual reading. I hate to say get your lawyers involved, but get your lawyers involved immediately in the AM.  
Q3: Assuming they're only reading via the glucometer when the continuous monitoring service is displaying urgent lows & highs ... Does it make sense that only a couple readings would drastically affect the average?  
A3: it's a little late for my brain to be mathing lol/I'm too far removed from my AP Calc days, and honestly trying to wrap my brain around how a glucometer does this math if there are only maybe 15 readings over the 30 day period... My conclusion is........you need the CGM data // maybe someone else reading this in the AM will have more insight ...... one way or another though, for the average over 30 days, when out of your care for those 30 days, is 400, and more recently 500+, but in your care=160-180 -- it is somewhat alarming they had that many extreme highs. Now, how long were they high, how long did it take the caretaker to verify with a glucometer? Was this a post meal high? Was it addressed immediately or did they let kiddo sit at 500 all night? Nothing we can answer. You need CGM data.

Assuming when in your care, you use Dexcom, and when outside of your care this last stint, they used Libre ... I'm nearly positive has something very similar to Dexcom Clarity where you can look at the aggregated dated from the last X# of days so you can access the information necessary to make more informed treatment decisions.

I hope this is helpful. And again so sorry you're having to navigate all of this in this manner. I hate the ADA for a lot of reasons, but it's my understanding they do have a robust legal team and you may be able to access resources via them for support.

A general update for those invested: 

We did locate several months worth of data, we are seeing very conflicting information from the initial hospitalization that led to 'diagnosis', appointment visit overviews that discuss the other parent needing to provide better care, various pharmacies being used in a way eerily similar to ""doctor shopping."" 
A lot of this is leading us to believe the other parent is paying out of pocket for medical visits and expenses (an issue they have presented to the courts) due to not actually receiving medical instruction or prescriptions for these. Previously we thought they were just refusing to use our insurance for the child due to pettiness/pride. The information we've gathered thus far, suggests that the past several months of glucose monitoring were actually intended to properly diagnose the suspected diabetes. It is stated several times in the emergency room visit that 1) the other parent had external influences on the child's nutritional intake during the stay [literally gave him IHOP, at the hospital, while under observation for the testing]; 2) lipids, hemolysis, and active RSV were all considerations for re-testing the metabolic panel; 3) incorrect family history on *our* side was noted by the other parent, and referenced as part of the diagnosis process in the most recent visit summary (they told the doctor(s) there is Family Hx of type 1, specifically. there is a grandparent who has *type 2*, they definitely know the difference as there is much mention of how their CNA position allowed for quicker understanding of the dietician's classes 

Cgm data reported to the doctors from the device(s) that we were not given access codes to for the follow app(s) displays horrifyingly frequent highs around expected dinner time. 
Child has directly stated, without prompt, that ""[they] eat a brownie *before* dinner, every night, to prevent lows"" 
This statement was made as dinner was being protested due to not first having a snack (approximately 45 minutes after a free snack - tree nuts - was given to maintain ~100 before dinnertime and discussing that they could not have a ""better"" snack ((better being their word choice))).
There were also ""Keto"" brownies provided in one of their bags, suggesting this isn't just a child lying about their typical intake to get more yummy treats"

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14gqirt,"For the first year after DX my son would shoot up so quickly to over 400 at the weirdest foods. We didn’t know he we T1D his BG was high for way too long and he was in DKA and admitted when he was DX. We were told because he was high for so long it would take awhile for his body to level out and figure out how not to freak out and go crazy high seemingly out of nowhere.

If the other parents are doing their best and CGM reading aren’t staying high all the time then I would chalk it up to a roller coaster day and move on. 

Do you have CGM on all the time so you can reach out if the kid is high or low? Even if you use an app for communication with the other parent you should have access to CGM readings all the time. If they don’t allow it take them to court and have it added to papers. 

I know it’s scary sharing a kid with T1D but you will have to work together whether they want to or not."

Not that unusual - they missed a injection for a meal. The rules say - manual test to make sure and then do a correction. If relying on CGM the rest of the time, that tester is fairly useless for Average. Only using for highs and lows."

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14gqirt,"People are answering in this post as if they have absolute certainty.  Truth is, there isn't enough information for us to do so.

There are a few parts to this question. 

The first part - is  528 dangerously high? Answer, yes. (If the child was still in this range right now, I'd be seeking immediate medical help, or at the very least testing ketones).

Second part - has this child been dangerously high at some stage. Absolutely, yes.

Third part - is it normal to have massive fluctuations when first diagnosed.   Answer -  certainly possible. Within my first month of diagnosis I had a couple of times I got to 420, due to miscalculations and the steep learning curve.

Fourth part - is this due to neglect. Answer: We can not tell based on the info provided. 

Scenario 1. The meter was consistently used multiple times a day, daily. Then this is dangerously bad management that is out of control. The caregiver is being neglectful or needs significant  education.

Scenario 2. The meter was used once or twice during the time period and just so happened to be a dangerously high reading at that time but otherwise during the rest of the time bg could have been at a safe, normal range. The caregiver made a mistake while they are still learn things.

Scenario 3. The meter was used regularly during the time period and once or twice the caregiver made a significant calculation error. The caregiver then paniced trying to fix things and was testing repeatedly every 5 mins desperately trying to fix things."

If they used this tester once to confirm a high - one test in 14 days means the 14 day average is that one test - 528. Not a good number, but doesn’t mean that is the true average. It could be a missed injection for a meal. Ask the other parent to confirm. If this was a CGM 14 day average, the child would be in DKA more likely than not."

Edit: If they are stable now then a hospital visit is not warranted at all. However you should still do the ketone test. I’m only saying do the ketone test because I don’t know how many days before this sustained stable values was the DKA. If it were very recent maybe ketones are still in their system? It would be helpful to you to know when the immediate effects from those sustained highs are no longer threatening the child. The ketone test can help give an indication on this."

1. No sensor readings, which makes sense
2. HIGH - over 400 readings. I'm guessing that the g6 stops sending numbers over. With no numbers, the o5 treats it like no readings
3. LOW - under 40. Same as #2
4. No trend arrow, CGM just reads 145, not 145→.   
This is completely a guess, but I figure the o5 needs to not just know the number, but also the direction it's going to most correctly adjust. Imagine if it gave you a correction dose while you were at 145↓

When it's grayed out, we just tap the field for the number and punch in what the g6 says. 

If it's a g6 problem, or if we're over 400, we do a finger stick and plug that number in."

"In the ER with type 1 girlfriend right now, been here before many times for DKA from high blood sugar but this is the first time for a seizure…","I woke up at 5am this morning to the sound of her next to me gurgling, I immediately started panicking and identified it as a seizure, she was foaming, arms twisted upward and convulsing. It was fucking terrifying. I had no idea what to do, she always said if she goes unresponsive to give her the glucagon shot, I wanted to test her blood quickly before doing that and was able to and she was not low she was 94. I decided not to even bother looking for the glucagon. I didn’t know what to do, she was gurgling and finally at one point just looked wide eyed and almost as if she was choking and looking at me and she looked like she was turning blue. I thought she was trying to say she was choking so o tried to sort of turn her on her side and squeeze her abdomen from behind in case she was choking on something, I was on the phone with 911 and an ambulance showed up within about 5-10 minutes I can’t even really remember. I felt completely powerless and I still have no idea what I could have done to help or save her life. She stopped convulsing and appeared to start breathing again before the ambulance even arrived and was sweating profusely.

What is baffling me is how could she have gone into a seizure if her blood sugars were normal? Dexcom said 95 and the 3-4 blood tests I gave her during her after she started breathing again all read between 90-110.

She has never had a history of seizures except for diabetic ones from the super low sugars. What else could have possibly caused this? The only thingy we’ve done differently is going for bike rides the past two days for the first time in a long long time. It was a strain on her body but we managed her sugars and she said she felt great afterwards, the only other notable thing is that she had trouble falling asleep last night which doesn’t usually happen she can sleep pretty easily every night.

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14g5zp9/in_the_er_with_type_1_girlfriend_right_now_been/,"Story is exactly the same as something I went through a few years ago. My husband is T1 and had a tonic clonic seizure (similar to what you described) in the middle of the night. His blood sugar readings were normal/in range before and during the seizure. I had to call 911 and at first the paramedics were convinced it was blood sugar related and were surprised when he kept reading normal. He ended up having another seizure in route to the hospital. While in the hospital he had multiple tests to confirm the seizure was completely unrelated to the diabetes. We realized after the fact he’d been having small seizures (focal aware seizures) and didn’t realize that’s what they were. He’s been treated with anti seizure meds for about 3 years now and is doing well. All of this to help provide insight and what things I wish I would have known at the time:

1.  Witnessing a seizure (especially waking up to it in the middle of the night) is a truly horrific experience. Don’t be surprised if you have some sleep anxiety after. That being said, as awful as a seizure looks it often isn’t as harmful on the body as you would imagine. Many neuros have told us people often feel rough after but in most  situations a full recovery in a day or two is expected. How it looks is 100x worse than the actual damage being done in the moment if that makes sense. 

2. You did everything right in this situation. You stayed with her and got her help and checked her blood sugar. It’s hard to keep a level head in that situation but you did just that. Unfortunately first aid for a seizure is basically to do nothing. If it happens again you can call for help but mostly you just want to stay with them and try to be hands off (don’t restrain them, don’t try to put anything in their mouth, and dont try to move them unless they are in a dangerous location). Things that can be helpful: timing the seizure and filming it for the neurologist to review. They want to know if it was on one or both sides, how long it lasted, and any events/symptoms leading up to it. 

3. It’s absolutely possible to treat epilepsy/seizures and T1 diabetes simultaneously and effectively. My husband has a 5.7 A1C and still has auras from time to time but is doing well and overall healthy! Blood sugar can definitely be a seizure trigger but for him triggers seem to be more anxiety/lack of sleep- they are different for everyone.  

4. Looking for a “why” the seizure happened is a slippery slope and you can drive yourself crazy. I went through a period of trying to help and monitor all sorts of vitals, but there are just too many factors to account for and it’s basically impossible to predict. You can learn the triggers and avoid them but in general just trying to live a healthy life and take medicine regularly/on time has been the consistent advice. 

Hope you get some answers soon and so sorry you both had to go through all of that."

It's also possible her liver pumped glucagon during the hypo seizure causing it to rise to where you got a normal glucose reading. That would explain the huge rise in glucose levels now.

Maybe get some opinions from a few doctors. Sometimes doctors will automatically just blame every health problem a diabetic has on diabetes. Just keep a close eye on everything.

What is her BG range normally?  Does she often run high?  People who tend to run high a lot can feel symptoms of a low at normal numbers.

Unfortunately people with T1D are most likely to develop many other health conditions .

On the top of the list were other autoimmune diseases like celiac ( and she just got diagnosed with that one as well ) , but there were diseases that are not autoimmune . For example a t1d 3 times more likely to get epilepsy than someone without diabetes .

I would see a specialist either way not just bank on whatever a generic PCP says. Be highly skeptical of anyone that shrugs it off or hand waves it away as diabetes, that’s bullshit.

I've been living alone, it's not been easy esp in third world country with no cgm but just strips. I even had to convince doctors to switch me to a basal/bolus something they did reluctantly and even said I was on my own since they didn't want me to move from 70/30 something I'm glad I did, My a1c has been fine 5.7-6.

The only scary thing I've experienced occurs when I go low. I can't tell how my body will react and the confusion even affects coordination. I have some energy to move around and even notice that what I'm doing doesn't make sense but somehow I can't manage to control myself to do the right thing. This is my only issue. Fortunately never been to the er since I was diagnosed due to hypo/hyper but I'm trying to figure out a way to import a cgm possibly freestyle so I can at least figure out what goes on when I'm not looking as I only test once a day when going to sleep."

Didn't have any symptoms of a low before that. I wasn't sure if I'd make it to the end of the block, or just fall down. Later on I noticed my tongue was bruised and bloody on the end, so apparently I bit it and didn't notice.

I was on a walk to a store 4 blocks from my house and didn't have my glucose monitor, so I'll never know. It would have to be fairly off or dip really fast for my glucose to have been seizure-level. I consumed 25g carbs and my glucose didn't go high, though, so... that's a clue that it was low. 

My doctor offered to refer me to a neurologist and said if it happens again, go to the ER to be scanned. I said assumed it was by blood glucose, but I'd take her up on the referral if it happens again."

It’s possible that she was not a 90, and was lower. That is already fairly close to being low so if the meter is even a few Mg/dl off… I’d trash the meter and get another one right away just in case. It’s possible she was lower in her sleep, and spiked up a bit thanks to liver releasing sugar. It does that!

Also, some severe lows your liver starts dumping lots of those stores into your blood which can cause a massive spike. That’s essentially what a glucagon does. If anyone in the ambulance or hospital administered one, it would absolutely spike you to 400.

Also great job on your fast reaction!! You are amazing!"

This is all very helpful information, if I could do it again I definitely would have done more to protect her from falling off the bed, between checking her sugar and calling police and looking around for the glucagon that I ended up not needing I don’t even remember the moment between when she was on the bed and when I saw her on the floor. It was absolutely horrifying and I don’t think I’ll be sleeping very deeply for awhile, at least I hope I don’t. I just can’t imagine what would be different if I didn’t wake up, and I wish I knew how long it was going on before I did wake up. They asked us which side it seemed to be on and I didn’t know. We are waiting on a brain scan and then a doctor talk."
"In the ER with type 1 girlfriend right now, been here before many times for DKA from high blood sugar but this is the first time for a seizure…","I woke up at 5am this morning to the sound of her next to me gurgling, I immediately started panicking and identified it as a seizure, she was foaming, arms twisted upward and convulsing. It was fucking terrifying. I had no idea what to do, she always said if she goes unresponsive to give her the glucagon shot, I wanted to test her blood quickly before doing that and was able to and she was not low she was 94. I decided not to even bother looking for the glucagon. I didn’t know what to do, she was gurgling and finally at one point just looked wide eyed and almost as if she was choking and looking at me and she looked like she was turning blue. I thought she was trying to say she was choking so o tried to sort of turn her on her side and squeeze her abdomen from behind in case she was choking on something, I was on the phone with 911 and an ambulance showed up within about 5-10 minutes I can’t even really remember. I felt completely powerless and I still have no idea what I could have done to help or save her life. She stopped convulsing and appeared to start breathing again before the ambulance even arrived and was sweating profusely.

What is baffling me is how could she have gone into a seizure if her blood sugars were normal? Dexcom said 95 and the 3-4 blood tests I gave her during her after she started breathing again all read between 90-110.

She has never had a history of seizures except for diabetic ones from the super low sugars. What else could have possibly caused this? The only thingy we’ve done differently is going for bike rides the past two days for the first time in a long long time.

She has never had a history of seizures except for diabetic ones from the super low sugars. What else could have possibly caused this? The only thingy we’ve done differently is going for bike rides the past two days for the first time in a long long time. It was a strain on her body but we managed her sugars and she said she felt great afterwards, the only other notable thing is that she had trouble falling asleep last night which doesn’t usually happen she can sleep pretty easily every night.

I've been a diabetic for 41 years, along with my brother and sister. I am also a nurse. I've had so many glucagon shots it's crazy. Have your girlfriend ask her Dr for the new improved nasal spray glucagon. My boyfriend is scared of needles, and it has made it so much easier. Our 7 year old can do it. He hasn't had too but he knows how."

There’s also been the heat bothering us as the upstairs bedroom gets terrible AC circulation. Maybe that was a factor, we also very recently started doing some pretty intensive bike riding in some parks locally and that’s definitely a new stimulus we didn’t have before. It is disturbing me to my core about what exactly may have happened and I greatly appreciate everyone here who is sharing their insight. Thank you. Visiting hours have ended and I’m home now and they were hooking her up to an EEG monitor for overnight. I’ll update with anything that comes to light during all this so that it may help someone else and for general posterity. Thank you!"
"In the ER with type 1 girlfriend right now, been here before many times for DKA from high blood sugar but this is the first time for a seizure…","I woke up at 5am this morning to the sound of her next to me gurgling, I immediately started panicking and identified it as a seizure, she was foaming, arms twisted upward and convulsing. It was fucking terrifying. I had no idea what to do, she always said if she goes unresponsive to give her the glucagon shot, I wanted to test her blood quickly before doing that and was able to and she was not low she was 94. I decided not to even bother looking for the glucagon. I didn’t know what to do, she was gurgling and finally at one point just looked wide eyed and almost as if she was choking and looking at me and she looked like she was turning blue. I thought she was trying to say she was choking so o tried to sort of turn her on her side and squeeze her abdomen from behind in case she was choking on something, I was on the phone with 911 and an ambulance showed up within about 5-10 minutes I can’t even really remember. I felt completely powerless and I still have no idea what I could have done to help or save her life. She stopped convulsing and appeared to start breathing again before the ambulance even arrived and was sweating profusely.

What is baffling me is how could she have gone into a seizure if her blood sugars were normal? Dexcom said 95 and the 3-4 blood tests I gave her during her after she started breathing again all read between 90-110.

She has never had a history of seizures except for diabetic ones from the super low sugars. What else could have possibly caused this? The only thingy we’ve done differently is going for bike rides the past two days for the first time in a long long time. It was a strain on her body but we managed her sugars and she said she felt great afterwards, the only other notable thing is that she had trouble falling asleep last night which doesn’t usually happen she can sleep pretty easily every night.

I’ve had type 1 for 30 years and never once been in DKA or had a seizure and I have no signs of complications. 

There is a light though. 2 insulin pumps have been approved in the last month that can almost manage diabetes with very little user input. These might be lifesaving for her. The first is the iLet pump from Beta Bionics and the second is the Medtronic 780g pump. The iLet used Dexcom and figures out her carb ratios and correction scale and all she has to do is push the mealtime button around the time she starts to eat. Most people with gastroparesis need to take insulin right as they eat or a few minutes after starting to eat since the food takes longer to absorb. A strategy for gastroparesis is to take half the insulin dose right before she eats and then the remaining half about 30-60 minutes later if she finishes everything and doesn’t vomit. 

The Medtronic 780 figures out insulin doses also and has different targets. It can automatically bolus if she forgets and potentially achieve 70% time in range with very little user input. With good carb counting it can get 80-90% time in range. 

You’re doing a good job but also remember that you can’t manage her diabetes for her. She has years of habits and probably poor training that she has to work out herself.  All you can do is support her and be there for her but in the end it’s ultimately up to her to get a handle on this."

The Medtronic guardian 3 was junk, but the 4 which comes with the Medtronic 780 is a major upgrade, biggest downside is 7 day wear. 

I’m pointing out to OP that this is a manageable disease. I’m not offering advise. There is plenty of good advise on here but he needs to hear the truth. Her current trajectory is not compatible with living 5+ more years. He won’t be able to fix her and she likely won’t let him fix her. My biggest condolences to his girlfriend, but she’s not the one trying to help herself then there’s really nothing he can do about it. People need to not sugarcoat her situation."

if her diet consists of a lot of carbs lower that, abd make sure insulin ratio is figured out (annoying to do but not impossible) AND DO THE FUCKING INSULIN BEFORE EATING. dka doesn't happen over 2 hours dka happens after being high for an extended period of time so if shrs actuslly in dka that often, unless she had an infection that won't leave then it's from uncontrolled blood sugars. a consistent glucose of 200 is on the high side aswell"

Been all over the world and well off the grid at times. #1 - I always purchase travel medical insurance in case of emergency. That just helps with anxiety traveling, knowing I’m financially covered if I start have diabetic complications. 

#2 - if you’re able, build a pack of all your normal supplies you’d need for whatever timeframe you’re traveling. THEN build an identical backup kit. 

#3 if you’re worried about keeping insulin cool, FRIO packs are water activated and help a lot. 

Let me know if you need anything else and have a damn good time! It’s just another day being diabetic 😎"

This sounds like a whole host of issues that indicate something other than diabetes though. Being shaky and lightheaded after eating a substantial amount of carbs/sugar is abnormal. Usually, the shaking, loss of balance, being lightheaded, etc. happen when you need sugar. Peeing a lot is typical of diabetes, but can be many other things as well.

Also, she is always very shaky, no matter if she eats. she could eat a whole feast and still feel shaky. Her heart rate is also very irregular, in the sense that doing something simple makes her heart rate go up. She has also had some ongoing gastrointestinal issues. Her family has a history of Type1, but her mother and grandmother/ grandfather do not have it. Does this sound like type 1 to you?

To add: There is a doctors appointment made. Thank you all that have replied to this so far!

UPDATE!: The doctors appointment went well. The doctor says my friend is orthostatic, and also thinks she has tachycardia (wants further testing) and also thinks she is anemic.

How do I get my endocrinologist office to do their job?,"I’m a little frustrated. 3 months ago I reached out to my endocrinologist office to let them know that I just got alerted that my prior authorization for my Dexcom G6 had just expired and they needed to submit a new one to refill my order. I also asked my endocrinologist to switch the company I got my Dexcom from because the DME was a pain to deal with as a patient and trying to reorder supplies or get updates. I wanted them to submit a new prescription and prior authorization to Express Scripts to get all of my prescriptions in one place and make it easier for me. That was 3 months ago and I still don’t have any Dexcoms. The old nurse I dealt with was amazing and would have things like PAs done and submitted in a day or two but she left the company, and the new lady I’ve been dealing with keeps messing up and I think doesn’t know what she’s doing. I’ve called my insurance company, express scripts and my doctors office to talk to her and my actual doctor on multiple occasions to get any updates and it always seems that she has messed something up or forgotten. I’ve gone in physically multiple times to talk to her about it and get sample Dexcom G6s to keep me going since I’m on the Omnipod 5. I’ve called Dexcom so many times for “failed sensors” that I’ve reached my limit and they won’t send me anymore for 90 days. The last instance my insurance company called me and said they denied the prior authorization because she didn’t fill it out properly and didn’t put any diagnosis on it so it got denied. Now she’s trying to use another company (DME) because they are “easier to deal with” but yet she submitted for the G6 intro kit, which I’ve said multiple times I do not need and I only need the sensors and transmitters. That was two weeks ago and she hasn’t corrected the prescription or submitted a PA to the new company. How do I get them to do their job? It’s been 3 months of playing the middle man and calling everyone for updates and communicating back and forth between the different companies because they can’t figure out how to do it themselves? I’ve even called and asked to speak to my doctor about this, and again to speak to anyone else about this and both times, the same lady I’m having issues with calls me after about 30 minutes and says she’s still trying. It’s been 3 months and I’ve grown extremely frustrated and don’t know what to do.

There are some basic rules they give you as a starting point, and from there, you figure out what works for your body. The system you use doesn't really matter if you eat fairly consistent types of food. Your ratios will be different if you choose to count fiber as carbs or subtract it, etc. To have the most dietary freedom, dealing with fiber, fat, protein, sugar alcohol, and normal carbs as separate things and considering them all separately, but this is also the most work for each meal. In most cases, protein is handled by basal insulin and only needs to be considered when eating excessive amounts (like double your standard amount or more). If you are on a high protein/low carb diet, counting protein can be VERY important, but otherwise it is something you consider when eating something out of the norm. Some count fiber, while others don't. Personally, I subtract fiber but spent years not doing so (diagnosed in 1990, and we knew much less about how food digests) without having any problem. You don't typically eat enough fiber for this to matter, even on a high fiber diet. It might make a 10% difference in your carb count, but that difference will be calculated into your carb ratio once fine-tuned. The only time this will matter is if you eat very little fiber some days and very high fiber on others. 

Basically, choose a lane. Count what you think sounds reasonable for you and stick with it. Once you decide what you count, be consistent - changing midstream just causes complications as your ratios work for your old method. There are valid reasons for each system, but you can have great control using any of them as long as you pay attention yo your body.

I personally count net carbs (total - fiber and sugar alcohol), but I also eat modest amounts of fiber (severe gastroparesis - fiber definitely doesn't digest for me) and almost no sugar alcohol (causes gastric issues and I have been told to avoid it and all artificial sweetners)."

This is the simple most effective way we found to keep things in range almost all the time.   A lot of people may be more advanced and that's when they do a lot of this other counting stuff.   
But I recommend doing things very simple and leaning your body for at least 2 or 3 years.
We went through a honeymoon phase where her body started producing insulin again and we actually were able to stop using insulin all together for about a year,   but we kept checking it and sure enough it came back.    And now everything is pretty easy to manage just by following a couple simple rules.        One of the most important things is don't ever overdose...   For example if your blood sugar is 100 before you eat a 20-carb meal,   then don't dose.

That said, I think most people are best off moving to a strategy of ""small, medium, large"" rather than specific carb amounts. 

The carbs are only a small part of the total equation, activity level, insulin resistance for the day, fats and protein contribution, carb variance on the nutrition facts. Counting the carbs to a very specific number and then taking none of these other factors into account leaves you pretty far off the mark. 

You could, of course, add in calculations for all those things, but it gets pretty intense.

So, might be better to go off more generalizations and take more factors into account than specifics."

Biology is weird. Not all bodies act the same, and that goes double for diabetic bodies. 

So, you do the “guess and check” method, just like back in math class. Bolus for total carbs. Did you go low? Do you always go low doing that? 

If so, try net carbs. What happened? Too high? Too low? Tweak your dosage whichever way to stick the landing.

Part of being newly diagnosed is you’re learning, which means you won’t always get it right. And that’s OK. Just have insulin and sugar on hand to fix it when you realize you had an oops. After over a decade, I still have oops moments."

The ACTUAL precise thing to look for is the Glycemic index and the Glycemic load, in combination with the percentage of mono/poly saturated/unsaturated fats and digestible protein.  

But since every meal can't be a 5 page scientific dissertation, estimating the prebolus based on a carb/fiber ratio is more than close enough. Unfortunately there's no actual precise answer there either because there are different sugars.  You can test this yourself by finding the perfect carb/fiber ratio for calculating a bolus for a certain product, and then testing it on something else. It won't be the same unless the GI and GL is roughly the same."

He decided to check my sugar and it just so happened to be 597. He had a blank stare on his face so I asked, “is that bad?” and laughed. Little did I know my life would change forever. I just tend to panic with a lot of things, and now with diabetes, it’s been hard on me with what I consider higher numbers. I don’t understand how some people could manage dealing with being in the 500’s regularly. I guess hearing that does make me feel a bit better about myself and feel some compassion for them. Sorry to hear you had a bad experience, hope all is well with you."
Think I can get a tattoo?,"Sugars been running a bit higher lately. Unfortunately had my highest a1c to date about a month ago, aside from when I was diagnosed. My most recent a1c was 8.0.. However I put money down on my tattoo that I booked months ago and my appointment is coming up. My a1c at the time I booked it was 6.8 and I usually never go into the 7’s so i assumed I was fine. I asked my doctor if there would be any issues and he said I should’ve gotten it a couple months ago when my a1c was better.. (thanks doc). I’m also not the type to get small patch work done, I have large pieces done at a time and put down a lot of money to confirm my appointment. If i cancel I will have to wait another 6 months and also be down my $200 deposit. My sugar has been a bit better this past month and i can say i should be down into atleast the 7’s. Do you think I’ll be fine if I get this tattoo? I know having a higher a1c will delay healing time, but do you think it will heal poorly or get infected? I don’t want to risk having a huge piece of my body infected lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14ghb7v/think_i_can_get_a_tattoo/,"Hey, this might seem insensitive but you seem like a perfect candidate for anti anxiety meds, I’ve been friends with dozens of t1’s that have the same story as you, and as soon as they got on meds, all that stress got better. Definitely discuss this with your doctor and or endo, and I hope you get everything figured out! Being over 300 once, twice or even 3 times is not the worst thing in the world, however, when you get stressed you release cortisol, which INCREASES your blood sugar!!

Is DKA a painful way to die?,"In 2019 on Valentine’s Day I got hospitalised for DKA. It was probably the sickest I had been physically. I couldn’t stop vomiting every few minutes for hours on end, I had a lot of muscle pain all over, my tummy hurt and my throat was sore from the stomach acid. but the worst symptom by far despite all the other things was simply the extreme thirst I had. I had been connected by wires to something (I don’t know what to this day, I think it was something that gave me potassium? Except it wasn’t on an IV Pole) so I wasn’t allowed to drink anything as it would mean they would have to take out and reinsert the wires for me to go to the bathroom. 

the DKA made me feel really sleepy which gave me a strange peaceful feeling that I’ve never been able to experience since. It actually felt great (the peaceful sleepy feeling, not the other awful symptoms) and a part of me kind of craves it.

My DKA symptoms were caught early so I was treated quickly (although I still have long lasting symptoms such as being diagnosed with GERD not long after, unsurprisingly) So because of this I wasn’t able to experience the worse DKA symptoms like kidney failure or a coma… but that peaceful feeling I felt was really nice. And I was wondering if it would actually be a peaceful way to die?

I slowly lost the ability to breathe correctly, I couldn't talk or think, and I collapsed, and couldn't move. All I felt was anger and fear. Angry that I couldn't fix myself and fear because I knew what was happening. I slipped into a coma. I was lucky I wasn't driving and that I had the day off. I couldn't call for help because my brain would not read the numbers or words on my phone.

The body literally starts attacking itself in every facet as your blood turns acidic.  

I had baby dka 2 days after dx (was a weird journey lol), medium dka halloween 2010 when a bartender gave me tonic instead of soda and I had no idea tonic was made of sugar, then full blown nearly died like an idiot dka 11/14/2017 (world diabetes day lol). I’ll never forget the looks on my parents faces that night watching me hooked to two IVs (one each arm), wrapped in three layers of blankets from the warmer because I was so miserably cold/shivering, breathing felt like serious work that I considered was too not worthwhile… all caused by flu/food poisoning vomiting that I thought I could overcome on my own. Had been 10 years since dx and hadn’t really been flu sick for a while so forgot about checking for ketones, and sure enough even though my sugar wasn’t wildly high, the vomiting set it all down hill on a very slippery slope. Suddenly I was vomiting blood, called my mom to take me to ER, she showed up still in her scrubs (was a hospital RN at the time) and drove me right back to work 🫠 not sure if it was her scrubs or my vomiting blood, but I got a bed & private room right away, and 4 full days later, made my way home. 

Now I keep zofran on deck, don’t go on an overnight without it. I also have a blood ketone meter so I’m not guessing exactly what shade of brown the strip I peed on is 🫠"

I've been hospitalized three times for DKA in my 20+ years of having Type 1 diabetes. I can't explain all of the emotional and physical feelings I had from it, but I know the peaceful serenity you're speaking of. I was hospitalized for five days with an admitted BG of 653. When walking to the room I was sent to, I no longer felt anything (like the sickness and heaviness were gone- I couldn't see, hear, or understand anything being said to me) and fell to the floor. 

After hitting the ground, I realized I was dying; my organs were giving up and my last thought from that time was that there's nothing I can do anymore- so I stayed there. I did this to myself and I was defeated.

Nurses picked me up onto the bed, I closed my eyes, and never felt so calm in my life. I don't remember the next couple days there, but the hospital staff said I just slept. I try my best to not get there again, but this shit is rough sometimes and we generally do what we can 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

To answer whether it's a painful way to die, I think all things leading up to death is painful. DKA is aggressive and violent- that moment of peacefulness, calm, and ambiguity is followed by nothingness. It's painful and that relief is brief, so I don't endorse it.

It didn't and the immediate care couldn't get any type of sample from me due to the severe dehydration, which led me to a short coma from bringing my hydration back up too quickly.

Oh and highlight of this whole story. I ended up having to go back to the ER later the next week. As I was being walked back, a nurse from the DKA visit was there and was so happy that I was okay. I apologized so much because while they were trying to stabilize me, I was screaming at them because I thought they were trying to kill me. They couldn't give me any water because they had to track my intake/outtake, and I seriously thought I was dying from thirst. All I wanted was a glass of freaking water!

Your breathing becomes shallow and rapid because your body is trying to exchange the extra CO2 your is producing.

you are not alone, i also go through very dark periods of depression because of this nightmare disease. finding support from fellow diabetics and spending some time cuddling my cat brings me a little relief. knowing that i have to be strong and take care of myself so i can take care of her the way she deserves.

i hope you find a new therapist who is more supportive. sending you love and strength, you will get through this rough patch <3"

My therapist also had gestational diabetes with her 2nd pregnancy so has personal experience with taking insulin, so can relate to the carb counting/injection scenario, and gives me kudos for doing it for 48 years vs her 6 month experience with pregnancy. I think many of us T1Ds have trauma from the medical community, I was in a DKA coma for 3 days and had experienced severe neglect when I was 1st diagnosed, had an obese nurse stand over me and yell at me to finish all my food on my hospital tray when I had never eaten that much in my whole life!

I see a therapist who only sees t1s, partners extremely closely with the staff in endo clinic, and is one of the leaders in research for Diabetes Distress (short interview with him [here](https://www.consultant360.com/podcast/consultant360/lawrence-fisher-phd-diabetes-distress)). Have a few other DD resources, shout if interested.

He has changed my life, and often times we just touch on how the things I'm dealing with are tangential to diabetes. Or, often, it's like...I have shit going on in work / family relations, and then a diabetes thing happens that sets things over the edge - a normal therapist would just say ""big whop, another thing"" like OP's therapist did - but my specialist--he gets the severity/weight of t1, it's pretty special.

Also, IRL diabuddies are something special - very grateful for my ability to sit down to a meal with mine and just feel abnormally normal together

I learned recently more about complex carbs and freezing different foods like pasta, potatoes and rice to make them harder to break down. 

Have you ever had leftover pasta not spike you the next day as much as it did when it was fresh? It's because it was refrigerated and then eaten again and it made the carbs more complex.

From a rice cooker, I use the same utensil every time for scoops. I've gotten it right after awhile. On days I'm not physically active or didn't work that day, I add 10 carb count for the same exact amount of rice. Generally, I never go over 30g of rice carbs (excluding 10g difference for inactivity). This is with CGM and insulin pump so I don't know if pen injections would reflect the same way. How much do you all consider a large portion of rice? The reason I ask is because sometimes I want more but I'm afraid the breaking point of absorbing the carbs will exceed the insulin's active period time in my blood. Rice is a staple for supper/dinner most of time for me so that might change something as well. I notice a lot of people have the same reaction and I'm curious about food options that people find generally a pain to fool with."

Type1 Runners?,I’m new to running and am looking for some advice from current runners. How do you manage long distances and blood sugar? Diabetes has NEVER kept me from doing anything but this is coming close to becoming one thing I just can’t conquer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14foxlm/type1_runners/,"Would be a lot more helpful to know your setup. CGM? MDI is in some ways significantly easier because basal insulins like tresiba are not kicked into hyperdrive during physical activity like a pump basal of novolog/fiasp/humalog/etc. Pumps you wanna turn it off in advance of your run. An hour or so preferred but this is a your milage may vary kinda thing.

From there I mean, calories and an appropriate starting glucose level not heading down with rapid insulin in your system still from a recent bolus. Carbs before you get low in the middle of your run. Build up your stamina with long walks mixed in and lower the intensity until you get in better shape so it's not such a shock to your body.

I have a rapid acting source of glucose like smarties in my pocket, plus I also have my preferred incoming low snack, a 22 carb little box of raisins.

Biggest thing is staying ahead of it and not having tons of fast acting insulin still in your system, and if you do, then consuming a bunch of carbs/calories before you even start so as that gets digested its fueling the insulin and activity keeping you relatively level. If you get a legitimate low in the middle of a run you've already lost unless you have like...a giant glass of juice or something. Which I find profoundly annoying to bring with altho they do make ergonomic little bottles that can strap to your arm."

Diabetes has NEVER kept me from doing anything but this is coming close to becoming one thing I just can’t conquer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14foxlm/type1_runners/,"Congrats! I started running last year and it was hard to start, but love it now. Not sure where you’re at, but start with a 0-to-5k program. Keep at 5 to 6ks and eventually it just starts getting easy. Don’t add more than 10% each week if you’re stretching out your distance.

As for T1… when I started, I just left my pump at home since I was only running ~30 mins or so. As I got longer my endo was not enthused about that. I now have a “run” program in my pump (Tandem) My basal is something like 1/3 normal, and bolus about 1/4. You want about 30g carbs per hour of intense cardio - you may need a small bolus, or you may need none. Maybe hit the jelly snakes before you start :)

I carry glucose gel 15g which I can use for correction. I carry proper sports gel (30g) carbs to keep me stable. I keep an eye on my G6 reading and rate, knowing my real level could be a couple of mmol/L lower. If I’m 8 but dropping I might take a sports gel. I also carry a roll of glucose tablets as emergency backup.

You’ll have fun, if you take it incrementally (as you should regardless of T1) you’ll figure out what works for you just fine. Be sure to include very slow recovery runs. Enjoy!"

Diabetes has NEVER kept me from doing anything but this is coming close to becoming one thing I just can’t conquer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14foxlm/type1_runners/,"The best thing i’ve done is running first thing in the morning. I’m super insulin resistant in the morning (I hear most diabetics are) so it makes it very hard for me to drop. 

i ran a lot before diagnosis, it was so hard the first few years to get back to it. personally, i started really small 5 minute walks everyday, then 10, then 20, etc. this helped me see how my body reacts to movement in general. i learned the best time of day for me and how long it should be since my last bolus. from there i did the same with running! 5 minute runs, 10 minute, so on.

 For long runs I usually eat toast with peanut butter and no insulin to cover before! I also reduce my basal rate by about 25% about 4-5 hours before my run. 

Also, i recommend starting running on a treadmill if you’re able. it’s helpful to be able to stop immediately if you have to and have your juice and low snacks readily available. and you don’t have to deal with the heat messing with your levels as well (if you live somewhere warm!)

I hope this helps! i believe in you!"

Don’t forget to mix up the cardio too! Running is honestly really high impact and rough on your body. Good shoes, soft surfaces, walking, biking, resistance training can all have powerful benefits to your overall fitness and health."

Many T1Ds will develop hypoglycemia unawareness after a few decades. This begins with no longer having reliable, or recognizing, physical symptoms of hypoglycemia. For myself, prior to the tech we have today, I would check if I was able to focus (mentally) while reading and would eat immediately if in doubt (always had dates and walnuts with me). My wife used to tell me I was going low even before I knew it because my ear lobes became white — I assume this was the brain pulling blood to get the needed glucose : )

Now I have a pump (since 2004) and being able to manage basal rates, hypoglycemia is not longer a concern. My last 6.5 year average A1c is 5.6 (range 5.4-5.9) without hypoglycemia.

A sensor interstitial fluid reading lags behind real blood glucose by up to 20 minutes. I always insert a new sensor in the evening and do a fasting calibration the next morning and they're usually in close agreement (5-10mg/dL). Doing a fasting calibration ensures food or bolus insulin are not affecting the readings. It's rare that I have to make a calibration adjustment on my Dexcom G6 and after the fasting calibration I never have to do it again.

My sensor transmits to my iPhone and I can see the value and trend on my AppleWatch and respond accordingly i.e., no hi or low drama...

Dealing with a low as the non-patient can be horrible.  I do my best to never get to that point.  With CGM tech, the lows should be spotted much earlier as in the finger test days, we just have to pay attention (but not TOO MUCH attention, haha!).  Even if the CGM reads normal, the trending should give indication of where things are going.  And a once daily finger prick is always  a solid idea."

I rely on both how I feel and my sensor readings. But, I'm on Medtronic.

My understanding is that all sensors are affected quite a bit by remaining hydrated. The easy way to tell is a little funny to talk about. But, pee should be clear or a pale yellow. Any darker indicates some level of dehydration. And, that will affect sensor accuracy.

The reason for this is because the sensor is not actually testing blood sugar. It's testing interstitial fluid (just beneath the skin). So, getting a good reading relies on that fluid moving around sufficiently. And, that's all about hydration.

Another factor that I believe is common to all sensors is the age of sensor and particularly how often we've been high while using that sensor. Since the sensor has a chemical reaction going to test sugar level, when it's high, that reaction is happening faster. This is what it's measuring. But, there is also only so much of that chemical on the sensor. So, when we're high for a lot of the time, that burns through the chemical on the sensor and can reduce sensor accuracy.

This is all just my understanding of the situation. I'm not sure if it's the same for everyone. And, I'm not sure if Dexcom (a much better sensor than Medtronic) might be less affected by these things.

Hope this helps."

My cartridge is filled for three day uses. Lately, it's like 80 degrees in the morning and the heat index is usually over 100 degrees heat during the day until almost nighttime which is usually 7:30pm. If I'm usually working outside for the three days, by the second evening to third morning, my basal insulin isn't significantly off but I hover from 160-190 unless CIQ kicks in but then it hovers back. As far as food boluses, it worked fine. I'd eat and hit like 80/90-100 but after the food bolus wears off..back to slowly hovering higher than usual. I'm not trying to worry you as others have said that insulin usually can last for about a month not refrigerated though heat definitely can harm the product but body heat isn't really going to make the insulin ineffective. 

When I don't work in the heat for three days, my usual BG is 135 or below. If I work like one day in the heat, I can't really even tell the heat affect on my cartridge. After two days of basically minimum 10 hours of intense heat and humidity, it shows a difference. I written down when things would happen. I thought I'm maybe not drinking enough water, ect. and I've made significant changes. Still, I've got almost 3 months to go to figure this out before temperatures will at least hit 70s.

Accepting that it's okay to be not okay is the first step to being okay.... I know that sounds silly.

I honestly think a medical health professional should be a part of every diabetics primary health team. You can actually seek out ones that specialize in treating people with chronic conditions. 

Meds may be the answer. Maybe you just need to look at your life in a different way. Sometimes it helps having a perspective outside of everyone you know.

Before doing so. I advise you to read up about all the different kinds of therapists and different kinds of accreditations. This will help you filter out people who called themselves life coaches. But, are not challenging you and just telling you what you want to hear and taking your money. 

In the interim. I highly suggest either reading or listening to 2 books. Both by the same author Mark Mason

One

""The subtle art of not giving a fu*k""

Two

""Everything is fu*ked""

I really feel like they helped me in many areas of my life. But what I like the most is what he describes the first book as being.... In his own words ""A guide to suffering and how to do it better"".

I think many of us get our hopes up waiting on the day that someone's going to ride in on a silver horse and we're not going to have diabetes anymore. Once you accept that that is never going to happen, It frees up your energy to focus on the things that you can control... And make them more casual instead of such a burden.

Don't get me wrong. I still hope a dozen dudes on silver horses ride in proving me wrong. I just find it highly improbable in my lifetime.

Just be okay with the casual use of the f bomb, And make sure your kids and grandmother aren't around unless you're a grandmother likes to party."

I think firstly you should speak to a Dr. This doesn't mean you'll have to go back on any meds if you don't want to. Talking to someone naturally hopefully will take the pressure off a bit. 

Have you tried figuring out why you don't want to go out as much? Is it because you're worried you'll have a hypo and be left helpless? Maybe it's injecting in public? Do you think the anxiety is actually due to something social rather than diabetes related? Figuring this out will give you options. For example, if it's the hypos that worry you, putting a message on your phone lock screen or wearing a medical alert bracelet might ease that. Injecting in public was always a weird one for me but with the encouragement of friends I now don't care. 

Please please please have a chat with your drs, they will be able to give you resources or even could refer you to a therapist. I know here in the UK they have specialist chronic illness therapists that specialise in diabetes. 

Finally, how is your control? I know at times I've felt so much worse when my bloods have been sitting a touch too high. Maybe there's something in that with you? 

Best of luck and I'm sending you all my happy thoughts."

Have you tried just messaging your Endo? If you're already on a pump I'm not sure you would really need a physical visit to be swapped to a different one. If you've seen them in the last year and are doing fine maybe they'd be ok just swapping things over based on your request?"

I went on the pill when I was 15 because I had extremely irregular periods (sometimes lasted 3 days sometimes lasted 2 weeks and could be 2-5 weeks apart). Didn’t help blood sugars because I couldn’t figure out a pattern and most girls need diff settings for certain parts of their cycles. If you want to stick with the pill, your body may adjust eventually because you’ve been on it such a short time. It might also permanently change your insulin needs. Insulin is a hormone and our cycles affect hormones. 
I had a very bad reaction to the pill. My cycle never regulated properly with it (helped a little but not enough) and I had side effects that didn’t go away. They said to give it 2-4 weeks to regulate and get used to the pill and see what side effects leave and how it will affect regulation.
I’m the end it wasn’t for me and I tried about 4 diff pills. So I gave up. 
In the end when I was about 18 I went on the hormonal IUD. It got rid of so many symptoms of my period and my period actually left completely (the bleeding part). They explained to me that I still have a cycle so I do have hormonal changes (sometimes I feel cramps and get cyclical acne and cramps but smaller) but overall things improved immensely. The pill is a higher dose of hormones because it has to travel through your blood to all parts of the body to make it to reproductive organs. That’s why a lot of girls get mood changes like depression after starting. Having an IUD with hormones keeps the hormones small and keeps them where they need to be and not right through my blood (and brain) over and over. Although I technically 
This isn’t for everyone and like I said everyone is very very different but I did want to share my personal story. In the end the IUD made it so I didn’t actually need to adjust my sugars during the cycle at all. I also didn’t require any higher dosages than normal. I don’t want to sway you any way and I don’t want anyone coming at me that I’m giving wrong info this is just my personal story. What I’m trying to say is you can give the pill a chance and maybe you need a diff pill but you might also want to look into alternatives like the ring or the injection or something. I don’t know enough about those though.

the placebo week you may get a period , it might just be some spotting. i would recommend keeping pads / liners around or even getting some period underwear (they have thin ones that don’t feel any different) just in case. you can always talk to your doctor about side effects and seeing what other options you have even just calling the office"

T1D and birth control is such a frustrating combo, when I've talked to my endo and ped about painful periods (I have a male endo and male pediatrician) I've just been told to take ibuprofen. When I spoke to gyno they mentioned other forms of BC but said to start off with the pill as long as I could remember it daily. Gyno also told me my irregular periods are just because I'm diabetic. It genuinely felt really frustrating to hear, whether it is true or not, there was no deeper digger, just told I would start the lowest dose of BC and that irregular periods were related to diabetes. I'm really hoping my body will just adjust as it gets used to the birth control, so far it's helped with cramps and heaviness of my period which is amazing. It has definitely had a major impact on mood swings, i ended up crying at work last friday because I was super stressed about that night (it was chaotic and my coworker called off), me and my boss were in the back talking then another coworker came back and said she was off in an hour, I panicked and just started crying, laughing at myself too ofc and just said ""I blame the BC"" my boss and coworkers laughed and agreed that definitely had an impact. one of my coworker friends (the one that said she was off in an hour) has also been on the pill but for a lot longer and has emphasized for me to watch my mental health closely because it almost put her into a ward because she didn't take care of hers.

Can Omnipod 5 work with ultra rapid insulin like lyumjev?,"We’re getting a pump soon for my 6yo t1d kiddo.

But, all in all, I doubt it will be a huge problem. If anything, I think it would tend to control highs better at first, and then have lingering ""backside"" stubborness of bg.

Like, when going high, it would likely react strongly at first, bringing you down, but then assume the insulin has more strength left in it than it really does, so it might reduce your basal and you could have some trailing highs in hour 4+.

For a 6yo, that's probably still a win.

Fiasp and Lyumjev are not “twice as potent” at any point, by any recognized method of evaluation. 

The fastest-acting insulin available (Affrezza) actually requires HIGHER doses to achieve the same effects as injected bolus insulin. By your “logic” it should be less.

I prefer Tandem with Control IQ. Everyone has their own preference though. The reason I like Tandem is because the algorithm for me is much better. I think part of it has to do with the 30 minute prediction that Tandem with Control IQ has. I know when I use Tandem and control. IQ is enabled. The pump will bring me down automatically. It may take a little time, but it definitely will bring me down from a high blood sugar. Another nice feature is it has extended bolus even when control IQ is on you can still do an extended bolus for meals. Another thing you can adjust your basal rate when control IQ is on you can go up or down with it. The Omnipod5 does not have this option when in automated mode. Like I said, everybody has their own preference nobody can tell you which one you’re going to like better it’s really up to you. You’ll have to try them both. I will say I have a much better experience with Tandem when control IQ is enabled,. For me Tandem is just much better. But I will say some people do have problems with Tandem. It doesn’t work so well for them. But for me if I had to pick one, it would definitely be Tandem with Control IQ. The Omnipod5 is prescription so you can get it through pharmacy. Tandem, with controll IQ is DME. It goes through insurance differently than the Omnipod5. You could probably  get both and switch between them if you wanted to."

I had like a bag of chips today at lunch, which I took proper shot for but eugh feeling crummy after that.

I know fruits and veggies should be fine. What about having some protein and fats that don't need refrigeration?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/14et7o8/what_are_some_healthy_non_refrigerated_foods/,Hopefully it’s not for too long. As long as you keep your insulin room temp it should be good for at least a month
