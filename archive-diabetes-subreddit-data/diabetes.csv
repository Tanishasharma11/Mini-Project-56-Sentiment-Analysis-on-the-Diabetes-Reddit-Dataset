2023 Community feedback loop results,"Hi members of r/diabetes 👋

**TL;DR**
We got some feedback from the community. Overall responses were positive but we also have some points where we can improve.
**/TL;DR**

A while ago, we joined the Reddit Feedback Loop initiative in an attempt to learn more about what you think about the community and our moderation of it. For this, Reddit selected a bunch of people who’ve visited the community or have done so in the past and invited them to fill out a survey.

The pool of invited participants was very varied and included daily participants as well as lurkers, and even users who had previously been banned.

Questions ranged from rating the community on a scale from “very dissatisfied” - “very satisfied” to open-ended questions where the participant could provide detailed feedback about their experience here. Of course, Reddit anonymized all the responses and removed harassing content before sending it our way.

I’m happy to report that Reddit has had to remove not a single response for being harmful or harassing <3.

In this post, I’d like to present some positive stats, some points where we could improve, and respond to a few specific answers.

## Positive stats 

Let’s start off with some statistics that we’re happy with!

- 79% of respondents are satisfied with our community. 
- 69% of respondents agree that our community helps them fulfil their needs.
- 85% of respondents agree that the rules are clear and easy to understand.
- 79% of respondents trust that we make decisions that benefit the community.
- 91% of respondents feel that people generally behave appropriately.
- Nobody reported that they feel unsafe in our community.

## Points of improvement

- Many of the respondents report seeing a lot of medical questions.
- Some respondents think the posts are messy and could do with some additional filtering.
- 7% of respondents report seeing harmful content more than once per week.

## Specific responses

I’d like to specifically respond to several concerns or remarks we got.

###Too much mixing of type 1 and type 2 (and similar concerns)

I’m sorry you feel that the distinction between type 1 and type 2 is unclear. We’ve made efforts to clear this up by letting people select their own flair and also adding flairs to posts. However, some of the respondents say that they want us to pick a type and only allow that here.

We will not exclude any diabetic from this community. There already exist type-specific subreddits which are great places for such discussions. We believe that the shared experience of diabetes also deserves a place.

###I still see a lot of posts that break the “No asking for a diagnosis” rule

Unfortunately, many people who are anxious about their health don’t take the time to read our rules before posting. We try to remove these posts as soon as we see them, and have recently expanded the moderation team to help with this.

The best way to help us deal with rule-breaking posts is always using the report button. This makes a post show up in our moderation tools so we can quickly respond.

###We need more moderators

We’ve recently added two new moderators to the team and now have better coverage in different timezones. Hopefully this has already addressed the issue.

###The theme could be polished

Please [message us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes) if you want to help out.

###Please get rid of political content

⚠️opinion alert⚠️ there shouldn’t be a need to discuss diabetes-related politics because diabetes care shouldn’t be a political subject. 

Unfortunately, politics can have large effects on diabetes care. I can recall a (somewhat) recent example [about the $35 insulin bill](https://reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/wjvt6e/mega_thread_35_insulin_bill/). This was the first time we had to deal with such a large political discussion in our subreddit and honestly I don’t think we handled it very well.

However, simply banning all political discussions doesn’t help promote a fair and honest discussion of very important topics. Some people use Reddit to get their news, and something this important shouldn’t be hidden.

In the future, I believe that we should continue to allow political discussions so long as everyone remains civil. We’re not here to moderate what people believe or how they vote, only how they talk to others.

### Please add a “Vent” or “Rant” tag so I can filter it out

I can’t believe we hadn’t thought of this before. I’ve added the tag now :)

There were a lot of requests for very specific flairs. If you believe that we’re missing an important flair, please let us know in the comments here or by [messaging the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes).

### Please moderate people blaming type two’s for their condition better

It sucks that people still believe that T2’s have done this to themselves. It’s against the rules of our community and we remove any such posts. 
If you see someone who does blame anyone for their condition, please report the post so that we can remove it.

## That's it!

That's it for our response :) If you brought something up in the survey that I didn't mention, please know that we did look through the responses!

Of course, you're welcome to comment below or [message us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/diabetes) if you have any concerns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/13qfej4/2023_community_feedback_loop_results/,"['[removed]', 'Your submission was removed from our community for breaking our rules.\n\n**Rule 2**: Survey and research posts are not allowed.']"

Had control. Lost it. I don't get it.,"Informally diagnosed T2D in the hospital in late April with an A1C of 9.5.

I tried to over compensate by eating less carbs. It all came to a head on Saturday. I went to take a shower and felt incredibly sluggish, just zero energy. On a whim I took an at home ketone test and found 'moderate' ketone levels in my blood. I hadn't intended to go into ketosis, and was worried maybe I was DKA or something because of how bad I felt. I had a sandwich on whole wheat and then a salad and finally a piece of pita. Yes, bad, but I was very scared about my health. I slowly felt better but my sugar numbers were being weird.

Breakfast ideas,"So my diet is restrictive. Technically I'm still pre diabetic and I'm holding my own minus overnight readings.

Minimal Fat
Low added sugar
Low Carbohydrate
No dairy

Update: Husband did glucose test by chance yesterday and was diagnosed with T1D today.,"I believe the original post was removed yesterday for violating the community guidelines. In short, I am pregnant and have mild GD and husband had been complaining about leg cramps for past few weeks. Yesterday morning we decided to check his BG by chance with my glucometer. The readings were twice the higher cut off for fasting and 4 times high after meals. I posted about it here and thanks to all the comments we did go and see an emergency doctor yesterday. Though the process was tedious with NHS due to weekend,we managed to get an early diagnose of husband’s Type 1 diabetes. 
As per the consultant this is late onset (he is 36) and his only symptoms were regular leg cramps and 7 kg weight-loss over past two months. He had no classic symptoms like thirstiness, tiredness, abdominal pain etc. 
No one in his family had diabetes so he never got tested either. He developed it in past few weeks and this was an early detection. He is been given insulin and will stay at hospital for observation for next few days. He will be on insulin doses and has a class tomorrow on T1D education. 
It was by sheer luck that we decided to check his glucose and captured early diagnoses. I am so thankful to this community to take time to write comments and push us to take faster actions. If it wasn’t for the comments we might have not taken it very seriously and it could have been too late.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14ot0k0/update_husband_did_glucose_test_by_chance/,"['It’s a crappy diagnosis but so wonderful that the two of you were able to catch it so early, and before a potentially devastating DKA!', 'Many T1s are the only ones in their families who have it and many folks get it as adults.

I did not register so she asked if I could urinate to r which I replied yes please. The came back and spoke with the doctor. The doctor relayed to me you did not register on the finger stick and you did not register on the urinalysis. To that I replied I do not know what that means. She then stated this the finger stick stops at 600 in blood and the urinalysis stops at 2000. My reply is ok what does that mean. Her reply blood 120 / urine less then 400.

Looking for help/advise for my mom. Having issues checking blood.,"Hi, I think I used the wrong flare. Sorry if I did. 


My mother recently found out the she's diabetic? But it's not full-blown. She just has to take a pile twice a day. 


The issue is, when she's trying to check her blood, her fingers don't bleed enough.

You've got to provide us more info.  What system is this?  How does it work?  What insulin does it use, how did you acquire it?"", 'I am usually 100% to 90% range.

You choose your level of autonomy yourself. You can go from full manual to full automatic in every thinkable step at any time. \n\nIn my experience AAPS doesn't do unexpected decisions. BG too high, more insulin, too low, less insulin. In the beginning you need to adjust your constants from time to time, but you will get used to it very fast.\nIf everything fails your pump will fall back to basal rate, and you can manually enter bolus until the stack is fixed. \n\nG7 integration is not perfect atm, neither is the G7 itself, but I like it more than the G6, so I'm happy with it.\n\nIn the end I wouldn't recommend AAPS to anyone who isn't into tech. You need to understand how the different parts, pump, CGM, phone, (nightscout) interact, what they do and in case of a problem how to fix the individual parts. Being able to Google for problems and find solutions for yourself is really necessary. Being able to host a nightscout instance (if used) is a big plus.\n\nBig plus of AAPS is that you can mix and match all supported bits of tech. But sometimes you need to figure out solutions yourself. Also all your data (if nightscout is involved) is only in your hands. \n\nTech problems usually only occur if your stuff breaks. In my experience the software (stable branch) is rock solid. Having a second android phone as backup eases my mind, but was never needed until now. Also knowing the latest transmitter code is always a plus. \n\nMy Full stack:\n\n* Pixel 6, Android 13\n* AndroidAPS 3.0.1.3\n* Dexcom G7\n* Byoda App\n* xDrip+\n* Dana RS (will be replaced with a Dana-i)\n* Nightscout running in Docker on a VPS"", 'The whole DIY ecosystem is incredibly safety-conscious. The systems are designed such that interrupting the CGM data!(or the controller crashing, or just about any other event occurring) results in a reversion back to standard pump behavior. \n\nThe DASH pods and G6 I’m using are covered by their normal warranties. Absolute worst-case, I can always get my t:slim up and running again, so while hardware failure is a concern, there’s at least a plan to address it if it happens.', 'Not OP as well but our endo said to get the results we get with Loop, you would need to use Tslim, Omnipod 5 wouldn\'t get the same kinds of numbers in terms of average a1c, time in range, etc with 1-2% hypos.\n\nI think once you understand the tech and the possible issues and have good back up plans, then the headspace goes way down. Right now, I spend very little time concerned about my 9 year olds numbers and she goes to camp with terrible wifi and has to self administer insulin / sugar. I also rarely wake up / stay late monitoring her numbers. \n\nIf you can get an Afrezza script, I think having that with an automated system is the ultimate safety feature, I have heard of some folks take a very small dose of long acting daily to prevent the chance of a DKA. \n\nThe different systems / insulins will present different challenges. Right now, with FIASP our issue is pod failures and bad results on day 3 pods - this is a well known issue with ultra fast and what we should do is change the pod every 48 - 60 hours. We have occasional lows due to mis-bolusing / activity which we correct with hi-chews (4g). We almost never have \\_serious\\_ lows, those are nearly always the result of a compression low with the Dexcom.\n\nWith Humalog / Novalog, we had issues with getting stuck on a high or mistiming the pre bolus OR not bolusing enough soon enough (glucose safety limits) - that was \\_more\\_ frustrating IMHO so we switched to FIASP. I think our numbers with FIASP aren\'t that much better but the mental burden is much lower. \n\nI found that getting 50 / 50 basal / bolus results in our best days, glucose wise. That\'s not a true basal / bolus split, we use a patch for loop that switches between temp basal and microboluses if you are below / above a certain threshold (we\'re at 130). It seems to me that getting regular amounts on insulin results in a flatter curve and when basal gets shut off for too long, that\'s when we get our most erratic numbers. So honing your basal numbers takes some work but is worth it (and with APS you can use the Autotune program to help).\n\nThe other mental issue is ""forgetting"" whatever habits you are accustomed to. Everyone has developed ""techniques"" when using MDI / Omnipod / TSlim / Medtronic and when Looping or APS or O5 or Tsliming you have to learn how the machine thinks. For instance, lots of folks who Loop still phantom carb but the way Loop handles phantom carbs is total different from how Eros / Dash PDM handles phantom carbs. We use a patch to keep the basal on over a certain threshold (200 for us) and APS has some settings that adjust the ISF when at higher glucose but regular Loop can be frustrating for folks when they are stuck on a high BG number and loop keeps suspending the basal.\n\nIf you are technically minded and like getting into the weeds and also want to carry a single device, I think AAPS / iAPS (the new iphone APS branch) or Looping are better options than O5. If the word Github is foreign to you and carrying multiple devices isn\'t an issue, then tslim or O5 should be find as long as you don\'t mind a 6.5-7.0 a1c (which I personally think is a totally acceptable goal)', ""Really great info from everyone in this thread, thank you so much!  I am in tech and not afraid of tinkering, but my job is to worry about systems failing so I had to ask 😀.  I'll definitely be looking into this when the time comes for me!"", 'It’s a development version of AndroidAPS (AAPS). The system consists of: Omnipod Dash, Dexcom G6 (BYODA app), and the controller (A cheap Android phone to run both BYODA and AAPS). I’m just using standard Humalog for the insulin right now. \n\nAs to how I acquired it, that’s kind of a long story. Here’s the short version:\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I was finishing my run in the pivotal clinical trial for the iLet, and I was kinda pissed off after 3 months of using the thing. I knew I could do a better job of managing than that system was doing. After some thinking, I designed a quick survey to ask other T1s in online communities how they did their correction doses. I then took that data (it worked out to around 300 data points from 50 individuals) and did a bunch of statistical analysis looking for patterns. There was definitely a pattern, and I used a machine learning system to identify it and generate an equation that approximated it. I presented the results at the D-Data conference at the end of 2021, and one of the people who had been working on improving algorithms was interested, so we worked together to shoehorn the new math into AAPS’s algorithm, and this is the result.', ""I'd like to know the insulin being used too. I used AAPS with Novorapid and results weren't as good."", 'Without any manual boluses, carb counting, or meal announcements (or any other interaction with the pump)?', 'My digestion is (probably) a bit slower than average, so as long as the system can recognize the rise in BG and “bolus ahead” for where it thinks my BG will wind up, it works. \n\nFaster insulins will continue to improve results for the masses. (There’s already a solution baked into the underlying math to account for the faster pharmacokinetics). There’s a drawback, though, of dosing needing to get more aggressive with faster insulins. If you talk to folks who use Affrezza, correction dosing can be double what they would inject.', 'IDK, TBH. How many carbs in a 1/3 lb spicy bite hot dog from 7-11 smothered in chili and nacho cheese? Or a chicken sandwich or jr bacon cheeseburger from Jack in the Box? Two of any of those is probably a typical meal for me. \n\nI haven’t done any activity announcements (which is reflected in skimming along in the low-to-mid 70s at times) but some other folks are working on workout/activity detection based on smartwatch data, which will be a big help for people who need it. The effects of exercise can be really unpredictable depending on the % change in non-insulin-mediated glucose uptake.', 'We laugh, but the fundamental metabolism model suggested by the underlying math also suggests a pretty good explanation for the munchies and a potential treatment for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. \n\nIt also may explain why people get hungry again 2 hours after they eat Chinese food. 😳', 'There is not a commercial fully closed-loop system available. However, there is an active DIY Diabetes community that has developed tools that allow for people to run custom algorithms on either Android or iOS phones that can receive data from almost every CGM and can control some pumps based on those algorithms. Some of these experimental algorithms have advanced to the point where they can give good results operating as a full closed loop system. \n\nThe t:slim is not a currently supported pump because the firmware does not yet allow full control via Bluetooth (just bolusing), but we hope that the Mobi release will bring with it full control of the pump, and enable open-source systems to support it.', 'This is AAPS. There’s an equivalent available for iOS called iAPS, and it has this algorithm available.', 'That is really impressive. Thought you could only get that kind of result with FIASP', ""Roboticist (and T1D) here - I'm quite interested!

If you dig all the way down into some of the clinical techniques used to quantify insulin action, there’s a couple of fundamental problems with the “gold standard” hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. For one, it quantifies insulin response solely in terms of glucose, and insulin has effects on other aspects of metabolism too. Secondly (and probably most crucially) it attempts to understand/quantify an ongoing process by functionally stopping it. \n\nBasically, everyone is trying to understand a puzzle by scrutinizing each individual piece.

Tresiba suddenly causing nightly hypos,"I've been on Tresiba for 3 or 4 years now and was always very happy with it (1 shot in the morning, decent control all day, perfectly smooth nights at 80-100 mg/dL until morning).

&#x200B;

However, in the past 2 months or so, I've started needing more basal insulin, since otherwise, mealtime control went completely out of the window. No matter how much time I pre-bolused or how high my dosage of Fiasp, my BG would go through the roof. This is still happening to an extend, but increasing the Tresiba dosage helped greatly.

However, now I wake 2-4x a night with a BG of 60 or less. Eating 1-2 glucose tabs and a banana would normally spike me like crazy, but in many cases, this raises my nightly BG to 100 and then right back down to 60 across an hour or two (2:30 am in the picture). Anyone have this kind of change in insulin behavior and any ideas how to get around it?

If your issue is around meal time, it's an issue with either what you eat, carb counting, or short-acting insulin dosage. The next time you go to your endo, be sure to ask about this if it hasnt been resolved. But, for now, I know for sure that you need to take less tresiba if you're having so many lows at night, and try to take more fiasp. Take as much as you need to bring your BG down, there's no limit and you shouldnt feel bad about needing more.\n\nA consideration as well could be that your body is being a little insulin resistant for some reason.

Recently diagnosed,"Hi all,

27 year old male here (UK) recently diagnosed with diabetes type 2 with a HBA1C of 53. Been having counselling to help with the anxiety of it all and think I may be coming out on the other side hopefully. 

My last HBA1C back in April this year was 41. Mmol but that was going on a strict barely eating diet. Dropped down from 98kg to 77kg in just over 6 months. Getting another test at the end of this month.

I am also on a remission journey through the NHS but I have one question. My mother and sister and potentially myself are going to be getting tested for MODY. Does anyone have/ know what to expect? My sister is type 1 and my mum is type 2. ( insulin dependant.)

I am currently using diet only and I think I may have reversed a little bit of my insulin resistance but not 100%. 

As an example I went to mcdonalds with my wife the other day and had some food only a blue meal (.chicken burger, medium fries and a zero coke) bloods went to 8.4 and then gradually came down to 6.4 

I think this community is awesome and appreciate everyone sharing there journey!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14oz3ys/recently_diagnosed/,"['Knowing the damage to your body and mental health if your over 10mmol 2 hrs after eating, I would include medication Vs damaging yourself.', ""heya mate, \n\nFunnily enough I'm in almost an identical situation, similar age, similar length of time since diagnosis.

You're doing incredibly well. I'd also note that your starting weight is my goal weight, so that's impressive too. \n\nHave you been on a DESMOND course? If not, ask your doctor if you can attend one, I found it INCREDIBLY helpful for setting out what to expect, what goals to hit, what is realistic in terms of eating, and not for nothing, it was interesting to meet all sorts of people who are diabetic. People who were old, people who were young, people who were thin, people who, like me, are overweight. I was worried I'd be the youngest or fattest there. I was both, but that was a bit of a kick in the arse to be honest.\n\nThe point is, its actually a very good time to ask questions, to talk to other people with the beetus, to get a bit of perspective on what the disease is, and how to beat it back. It would be the perfect place to ask about MODY. Like they say, its the only chronic disease that is reversible, and it sounds like you're reversing it :)"", 'Are your mom and sister both insulin dependent? \n\nEveryone getting tested for autoantibodies would be the first step, I should think -- faster results and less expensive -- for process of elimination.

It did improve for me for example!\n\nGet your A1c measured every 2 months if you can, there are home kits for this. The diabetes research lab also measured my body fat and I spent time on visceral fat reduction. You can actually get your insulin resistance tested via the SSPG/OGTT or the IGII tests. See if you can find a study organized by Oxford or Cambridge for example. Those tests revealed a wealth of info to me. If you are part of a study, those tests are done FREE! :)\n\nRegarding MODY, the right way to diagnose and understand MODY (now called Monogenic diabetes) would be to analyze gene sequences. However, given the cost of such an approach, most docs will just see if diabetes was there since the age of 25. I don't think the diagnosis itself means much. The general medical procedure is to look at people's current sugar levels and prescribe a combination of medicine and or insulin to keep sugar levels under control. It's very useful to have a CGM to monitor their blood sugars real-time.\n\nAlso, I am NOT a medical doctor, but have access to medical journals and material that docs have access to because of my interest level after being diagnosed last year.

CGM vs Blood stick,I am struggling to use the information provided by my CGM effectively. I understand that it will almost never match my finger stick bc it’s measuring 2 different things and I understand I should use one or the other. Honestly I don’t think I would have been able to lower my BS as much as I have just using the CGM. For example this morning it said my fasting was 98! But a finger stick says 130.  So how do I use the CGM information in a way that helps me manage my BS? Do you all just use it to loosely monitor spikes? Am I missing something completely? (I have the Libre 3),https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14omtr9/cgm_vs_blood_stick/,"['(I have limited experience with Libre 2)\n\nCGM will have a delay, 20, 30 minutes between the current blood glucose and the interstitial fluids readings. (you probably know that) and blood glucose monitor, as well as CGM have a range of error, so at some point your 98 reading and the 130 reading can be close if you take into account the error margin.\n\nI think the CGM is more useful as a tool to show trends and to warn high or low BG.\n\nFor Type 2, at some point when you have control over your BG, it will just make it easier to monitor your blood glucose that it does not go wild in one direction or the other.\n\nIf I could afford it, I would get a CGM and do finger tests every couple of days just to confirm there are no outliers in the readings.', ""In the morning, your bg was probably already on the way up (as is normal when you get up/ move around), and the Libre didn't show it yet.

My sensors are +/- 2mmol from fingerstick readings but i have to place the sensor outside the official recommended site to get more accurate reading.\n\nI still do finger stick checks just to make sure the CGM is still accurate.

This made alot of sense because i am quite lean. So having it on the outer part of my arm where the skin doesn't stretch and move around as i go about my day seems to give me more accurate readings"", 'Yeah, My older sister freaks out when her varies by 10 points.

Overnight suggestions?,"Hello.

This is my first post here so I apologize if I make any mistakes. I've been prediabetic for about three years now. It has been a rough journey (it's a long story but I didn't realize until I already developed neuropathy, retinopathy and was really sick unchecked). 

I've been working super hard with a nutritionist and thanks to getting EPI from being on Metformin temporarily I have a mega restrictive diet.l (No processed food, no dairy, minimal fat, minimal animal products, minimal baked items). 

Up until April of this year my numbers have been great but since April I have continuously had morning wake up readings that are over 130. Sometimes as high as 160 and I'm starting to get really frustrated. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions to try? 

I know I'm not getting up in the night to eat. I am setting up an appointment for a sleep study because maybe ampea? I also do know I stay up late a lot 1-2 AM sleep usually 6:30 wake up.

Discovered I have diabetes (28 M). Feeling overwhelmed.,"Hello community. I have been a relatively healthy individual for the past year. I also am a graduate student in a US university and am in the process of wrapping up my PhD. Due to the stresses on the last stages in PhD, I gave up on exercising/walking and started stress eating, eating heavy processed foods and fast foods for the past one and half months.

My university health center's doctor wantse to meet again next week to discuss further on my situation and get additional tests done.

However, it's important to remember that with proper management and lifestyle changes, you can lead a healthy and fulfilling life.\r  \n\r  \nThe first step is to follow up with your doctor and discuss your test results in more detail. They will be able to provide you with specific information about your condition, answer any questions you may have, and guide you on the next steps.\r  \n\r  \nDiabetes management typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication (if necessary), and regular monitoring. Here are some steps you can take to regain control of your health:\r  \n\r  \n**Diet:** Work with a registered dietitian or nutritionist to create a meal plan that suits your needs. Focus on consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit your intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and foods high in saturated fats.\r  \n\r  \n**Exercise:** Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling. Additionally, include strength training exercises at least two days a week to build muscle.\r  \n\r  \n**Weight management:** Losing weight if you are overweight can greatly improve your blood glucose control. Consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to develop a weight loss plan that is safe and sustainable for you.\r  \n\r  \n**Medication:** Depending on your individual situation, your doctor may prescribe medication to help manage your blood glucose levels. It's important to take any prescribed medications as directed and communicate with your healthcare team about any concerns or side effects.\r  \n\r  \n**Blood glucose monitoring:** Regularly monitor your blood glucose levels as recommended by your healthcare provider. This will help you understand how your body responds to different foods, exercise, and medication.\r  \n\r  \n**Emotional support:** It's normal to feel overwhelmed and stressed after a diabetes diagnosis. Seek support from your healthcare team, friends, family, or even support groups to help you cope with your emotions and navigate the challenges of managing diabetes.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, diabetes management is a lifelong commitment, but with the right support and lifestyle changes, you can lead a healthy and fulfilling life.

I also skip my morning dose on fasting day and go dinner to dinner as a 24hr fast 1-2 times per week. It doesn’t seem to matter because I’m not eating carbs/anything at that time and my numbers are under good control at this point.

New LADA and a med question,"So, I was diagnosed Type 2 about 7 years ago but continually struggled. I had a DKA in 2021 but Covid plus a lack of endos in my area just kept me on the same Metformin and Ozempic therapy. 2 weeks ago had another severe blood sugar spike that landed me in the hospital and a new endo consult that tested my C-peptide and diagnosed me with LADA. I'm relieved and angry because I've done the major lifestyle changes, literally moved across county for better health care, and feel like I've been banging my head against a wall for years. I also feel like there was major fat shaming going on, because even after hitting all of the major check marks for LADA, including DKA, no further testing was done.

No joke, the last 2 weeks have been a complete health turn around with my energy and GI issues.

However, my mother passed away at age 63 due to complications of Type 2 (untreated). She ate a very carb heavy diet due to being vegetarian. I recently had gestational diabetes that required lots of insulin and have been pre-diabetic for years. I am not overweight, it is genetic. I was told I will be Type 2 in the future. I am scared. 
Now I'll get to the point, I am worried that my diet is too carb heavy as well because I don't eat meat for protein. I have tofu here and there but I'm not a huge fan of it either. I also have a history of fatty liver, and really should avoid dairy (cheese) and things with lots of saturated fat. 
Is the best solution for me to start eating chicken for protein? Has anyone else had to make a decision like this amd could offer some guidance/advice?

If you are comfortable, you can start with some meals that have meat integrated into them, rather than a slab of meat and veggies.

The “Impossible” meat is a great example.\n\nThat’s all to say, it’s awesome that’s you’re wanting to get yourself healthier at the sacrifice of your own morals, but it may be worth giving a plant-based, mostly whole foods lifestyle a go before giving up on said morals and feeling guilty about.

So am I. I was diagnosed last year at 6.9 A1c, and have improved my glucose tolerance (with several research lab tests) and have lowered my A1c to 5.4. I can't say I have fully recovered as my glucose tolerance when eating 75 grams of glucose is still worse than a perfectly normal person, but it's better than it was before for sure. The study also revealed that many perfectly normal non pre-diabetic, in fact 30% of them are worse than me glucose tolerance wise! Still I would like to go to the 50% percentile or better.\n\nI am also vegetarian and I discovered a few things along the way. Eat eggs, peanut butter etc for protein. I experimented with meat for many years and found that the saturated fat and components of red meats are not ideal. There are also many preservatives put into white meats like chicken. Obviously high quality organic meats raised by local farms are good but they will be expensive. The problem with salmon is the amount of mercury. Sadly, preservatives and mercury hurt insulin resistance quite a bit.\n\nI would change your habits into making sure you eat a lot of protein and vegetables and lower your saturated fat. Instead of avoiding anything with saturated fat, reduce your consumption to less than 20g a day of sat fat.\n\nGenetic just means you might have less lean muscle in your body. You can do workouts to improve. I went from thinking weight lifting is lame (and avoiding all gyms) to lifting 160 pounds of kettlebells in both arms in just 2 months! Females can work their way up slower, maybe start with 10lbs and go up slowly, increase the repetitions and weight. This is extremely important for Asian folk. Asians should aim for a BMI of 23 instead of the traditional 25. In fact, if you want to be diabetes free, a BMI of 21 is ideal, then your glucose tolerance would be amazing too.\n\nKeep measuring your blood sugar and A1c. It's fairly easy to control pre-diabetes, but it requires you to monitor your health. Get a CGM, and get a CVS A1c at home kit and measure your A1c once a month. Yes, this sounds crazy, but if you measure things consistently, you will care more for your health.\n\nOn meat vs vegetarian proteins, I have not noticed much difference in blood sugar and A1c. You can easily take vegetarian proteins, including chicken eggs (which are vegetarian but NOT vegan). While meat vs vegetarian sounds emotionally interesting, it does not change your A1c and blood sugar levels that much."", ""I'm not vegetarian or vegan, but I am diabetic.

I know it's a lower sugar intake diet, but I'm feeling like in combination with medication it's getting too low.

Over the past 4 months I’ve worked to fix my gastrointestinal bacteria to reduce the bad bacteria which has also included eating smaller portions and more often, if the need requires more of them; reducing my carb intake and identifying the carbs that cause stomach distress for me; increasing my fiber intake; eating other foods that increase the good bacteria; etc. Sincere I’ve been working on this analysis and these changes, most of my days are completely in range (80-160) without the extreme low or extreme highs. Obviously, I can’t be perfect and I’m still learning so there have been some days where the issue still arises but the highs from that are much lower, much easier and faster to recover from, and can require a bit more activity on my part to counter-act a sluggish intestinal tract.\n\nI don’t know if your situation is similar but hopefully this helps you look at potential situations you can identify to help with what you are going through because, yes, diabetes is very difficult and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.\n\n(I apologize for being long-winded.)', 'Damn!

I can’t fit in anywhere,"I am a former foster youth, and we have annual BBQs at the agency. I am extremely antisocial so I never really go to any of these, all I do is sit in a corner. 

I have been trying to better myself lately though and decided why not, I don’t have anything better to do so I went. Big mistake. Immediately the staff started talking to me, asking how I am etc and I feel bad because I don’t like lying and I’m tired of bottling things up so I say I have been struggling lately because of a diabetes diagnosis. 

I’m immediately blamed because one of the staff remembered that I “liked eating snacks” over a year ago. What? Then she started asking why I didn’t want to eat? I am a recent insulin user, and I have never used insulin in public before, minus a few times under the counter at restaurants. I already felt vulnerable with my CGM visible and when using insulin I got a weird look from one guy. That made me very ashamed of myself. And then on top of that a social worker says that I should have eaten better…

I was freshly out of a shitty home the last time she saw me, and in that home my food was limited, close to the point of being underweight. I would eat one meal a day, usually something with bread or rice, so I guess I’m the devil for *checks notes* wanting to survive. 

Then I move on my own at the fresh age of 16, and I wanted to buy snacks at the grocery store. Is it really the worst coping mechanism to have? I never overate, exercised a little, and started better portion control as soon as I hit 130 pounds. Is eating sugar for 1 or 2 years actually enough to cause diabetes??

All of this just makes me feel so ostracized from society. That even in a group of youth who have been through similar things in life that I have, I still can’t fit in. And the diabetes just makes it so much worse.

I ended up eating one cheeseburger with mustard on it. I wanted fruit salad, but the woman guilted me out of eating it because of the sugar. She said I needed to eat regular salad. I didn’t end up doing that, and I’m ashamed of it. The burger was all I’ve eaten all day. The bun had 33 carbs. I’m not sure about the patty, and the mustard probably had none.

Most of us at some point wonder what we did to deserve this. I am sure with everything going on that is kind of a double whammy. Here is the truth, you did nothing to deserve what life has given you. You are a valuable human being, or you wouldn’t still be here playing life on hard mode. There are a lot of really dumb people out there, from doctors trying to give dextrose drips to people with high bg to parents and kids saying you can’t eat that. It is unfortunate that we have to educate them on a disease that has been around since at least 600ad. \n\nI get that it is easy to be ashamed. I will say that, if you need to take insulin, ask to use the bathroom and take it there. It affords a small amount of privacy and may lead to less questions. If you want to make them deal with it, take shots in public, you have that right, but a lot of people won’t understand. As diabetics we kind of have the duty to explain what is going on to dumb people so that they don’t treat others like us as shit when we are just being tough enough to play the game of life on hard mode.\n\nKeep on keeping on, and know you’re not alone. Good luck.', 'You fit in just fine. One shitty social worker ruined this for you. Don’t let that one nosy know-nothing-know-it-all make you feel like you don’t belong. \n\nDon’t let yourself be ashamed of your basic needs. Use your medicine when you need to use your medicine. Feed yourself like you know how to feed yourself. Fuck everyone else. To me, this reads more as a lack of confidence, then an inability to fit in. Put yourself first. You do you. Ignore people like that social worker. Prioritize meeting others and finding “your people”.', 'Hi friend:\n\nI’m very sorry this woman was so awful to you. You didn’t deserve that. The unfortunate truth is that most people who aren’t endocrinologists or diabetics themselves don’t know a lot about diabetes (and hey, even some endos and diabetics don’t!). It’s important to establish strong boundaries with those folks - they think they know, but their knowledge is based on what they’ve seen portrayed in the media. \n\nYou know your body best. It’s important to work with an endocrinologist, especially when you’ve just recently been diagnosed. However, that should be a *collaborative* relationship. Tell your endo how you are feeling, what trends you have noticed in your blood sugars, and what you find works well for you / what isn’t working well. A good endocrinologist will take the time to listen, and help you make a plan that works for you and your needs. But you need to be an active participant in that process.\n\nI also understand how it feels to not fit in. It’s something that many people struggle with, and you’ve had it tougher than most. I encourage you to keep trying. When I was a young adult, I signed up for an app called Meetup to get myself out there. It’s an app that is used to organize events for people with common interests or experiences - for example, there are tons of them out there for people who enjoy gaming, physical fitness, going to museums, and so forth. Maybe take a look on there and see if you find something that sparks your interest?\n\nI also recommend learning to set healthy boundaries with people, perhaps with the assistance of a therapist. Having healthy boundaries will help you navigate adult relationships safely, and help you avoid toxic relationships. It’s hard getting started, but it will serve you well in the long run.\n\nI wish you the best of luck - if you have any questions about these things, please feel free to send me a message!\n\n- Your internet big sis', ""You don't have to fit in anywhere.

(WXYZ) — This is great news for the nearly 2 million people in the U.S. who have Type 1 diabetes. That’s a chronic autoimmune condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Patients must get lifelong care, which includes daily injections or infusions of insulin.\n\nThe FDA has given the green light to a cellular therapy called Lantidra to help adults with Type 1 diabetes maintain their target blood glucose levels.\n\nOften, patients suffer from repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, because they have difficulty managing the right dosage of insulin. And, sometimes patients develop what’s known as “hypoglycemia unawareness.” That means they are unable to detect when their blood glucose is dropping, and without treatment they risk losing consciousness or having seizures.\n\nSo, here’s how Lantidra will help. First of all, this therapy is made from deceased donor pancreatic cells. It aims to replace the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.\n\nAfter the initial infusion, the cells secrete insulin into the body. And, in some cases, these cells can produce enough insulin that there is no longer a need for the patient to inject or pump insulin in order to control their blood sugar levels.\n\nWell, initially, Lantidra is given to the patient as a single infusion into the portal vein, which is the blood vessel that delivers blood to the liver. An additional infusion can be performed depending on the patient’s response to the first dose.\n\nDuring the two clinical studies, 30 participants with Type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemic unawareness received between one and three infusions of Lantidra.

I'm using xdrip+ with juggluco, and usually just put in a calibration until I feel its stable, then delete all my calibrations and use the raw sensor value after that. I use the contour next one and accu-chek mobile, and have found the accu-chek to be almost identical to the sensor value after the first days at around 5.5 mmol, while the contour is marginally higher, about 0.5 mmol.

Numbers low after a week?,"I am recently diagnosed with T2 and have been diligent in testing and watching my diet. I’m also on 500mg of metformin once a day. 

I recently started working out on Sunday and my tests, which were normally in the 110-130 range are now down in the 80-100. I don’t feel like I’m starving myself, but I watch my carb and sugar intake, drink lots of water, eat when hungry, and go for walks daily if I’m not at the gym. 

Is this normal for number to go down that quick and stay relatively static? It just jumped out at me the number change the other day. Anyone else experience this?

Recent diagnosis questions (T1),"My husband was recently admitted to the ER with a blood glucose of 35 mmol /L or  630 mg/dL. Ketones of 1.3 They gave him two bags of iv fluid over night and one dose of short acting insulin and one Lantas the next day after lunch. His blood glucose came down to 23 mmol/L or (414 mg d/L) after 2 hours and ketones were at 1. They discharged him with a small amount of information a once a day dosage of Lantus and told us the diabetes nurse would follow up soon. The nurse rang today and booked him in for 10 days time from now …the only thing is that he’s been out of hospital for 2 days now and his glucose has not dropped below 15 (270) and fluctuates between that and 22(396) Ketones are 0.6. 

We are eating very very well using the plate method and trying to be really careful. 

How urgent is it that we follow up with someone this weekend / return to hospital about it not coming down below 15? The nurse phone line is only available Monday to Friday and it’s past Friday closing here in NZ. 

I don’t want any damage done while we wait for his appointment. 

Also any snacks for him that you guys can suggest I’ve never seen him this hungry. 

Thanks for helping us navigate this journey! 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14mvtn6/recent_diagnosis_questions_t1/,"['In NZ too had a very similar situation when I was diagnosed minus the hospital visit. Nurse wasn’t too concerned with blood sugar between 15 - 22 while your first getting the hang of it as generally it can take months/years to create serious damage. At least this is what the nurse said. \n\nWhat happened with myself at least is after that 10days, they did a 14 day trial for the Libre CGM. After a few more days of getting used to it they generally will put you onto fast acting insulin and give you a very brief run down on how use it.\n\nAny kind of high protein snacks are great for the hunger blues! Unsweetened yogurt, salami sticks, even the odd low sugar protein bars were great. Like atkins or musashi', 'You seem to be saying he was recently diagnosed, and only at the ER? If he has a GP/Primary, then you should definitely call that office and follow up there, too. He may want to try and set up an appointment for an endocrinologist, also, if he does have Type 1 diabetes. Endos specialize in hormonal issues. (Should also get a thyroid panel done, because autoimmunity shows up in different ways, and T1D and low thyroid may occur together in some patients).\n\n15 mmol (270 mg/L) is a lot better than where he started out at 35 (630). Not too sure about your ketone levels and the reference range, but I think below 1.5 mmol/l is in a much better place. Did they say he was or was not in ketoacidosis? DKA often involves a hospital stay for a few days to rehydrate and rebalance electrolytes, in a gradual way so as to avoid edema. \n\nType 1 is an autoimmune disease, and in an adult can take many months or years before it gets to be at very serious levels of high blood glucose, from loss of ability to make insulin. Did he have any previous fasting glucose or A1c tests?\n\nThe ketones are from his body switching to burning fat for fuel since it cannot access enough glucose for energy. Usually, the reason for high ketones is inability of the patient to make enough insulin of their own; but lower levels can happen from not eating for a day or eating a low carb diet. \n\nThe high glucose would have him urinating frequently to pee out the excess glucose, causing dehydration, so then diabetic people get thirsty, too. And the ketones will similarly be getting expelled via urination, rapid breathing, and in dire cases, via uncontrollable vomiting. All of which makes dehydration very dangerous condition, because electrolytes come out of the cells and cannot get back in, and the they get flushed out. The hydration with IV fluids alone would help to bring his glucose down some, and allow his cells to start functioning again, but did they look at his electrolytes, too? \n\nThe insulin will begin to let his body regain the ability to use glucose. And reintroduction of insulin shouldn\'t bring someone down to normal in a day if they have had high levels and are dehyrated like that, because fluid can come rushing back into tissues and the brain too quickly: edema.\n\nSo, 15 is not normal or healthy, but is maybe okay for day 2 and 3, and gradually you want to whittle it down with more water and more insulin, but no internet stranger here is qualified to give you medical advice, and can\'t tell you exactly how to titrate your husband\'s insulin needs. \n\nTo get a proper evaluation for Type 1, he would need an autoantibody panel, and maybe a C-peptide test. If he has 1 or more positive matches for autoantibodies associated with T1D, especially GAD65, it is pretty certain he has autoimmune diabetes. And will need insulin daily. His body probably still makes some insulin, but will make less and less over time. \n\nLantus is the brand name of the most popular basal insulin. Basal means like ""background"" or  ""base amount"" and is a long-acting insulin that may last about a day, depending on the person\'s ability to metabolize it. Some people it doesn\'t last a whole day. Blood glucose comes directly from your food -- primarily from carbohydrates (simple sugars and starches that break down to glucose). A normal amount of blood glucose is down around 4.5 to 5.5 mmol/l. \n\nInsulin allows most of the bodies cells to open up to accept glucose. Some cells don\'t need insulin to accept glucose, and he may notice this when his eyesight becomes temporarily different (farsighted) for a few weeks, because the lenses of the eye swell from the way they accept glucose. Extra glucose is stored in the liver and in muscles as glycogen (chains of glucose and water). \n\nThe pancreas has special clumps of cells called Islets of Langerhans, and these contain endocrine cells that make hormones, including beta cells that make insulin (and a hunger reducing hormone called amylin), and also alpha cells that make glucagon. The latter is a signal for the liver to release glucose back into the blood stream when glucose levels get to be below 4.5 or so. So, food and the liver storage are primary sources of glucose. Your body has the natural ability to sense food components (macronutrients) in the small intestines, which send signals to the pancreas to release digestive enzymes and hormones. And beta cells and alpha cells can sense blood glucose levels to keep the balance at a proper level. Why the beta cells alone get attacked by the immune system? Absolutely nobody knows.\n\nBut the ""basal"" insulin is supposed to compensate for the liver\'s release of glucose. And maybe this is all he needs to start his care. But eventually, T1D patients will move on to using rapid insulin to do ""bolus"" shots whenever food is eaten. For people using insulin pumps, there is only rapid insulin in use, and the pump has a ""basal setting."" \n\nYou will be monitoring his glucose manually with a glucometer several times per day. Or if your health care system/insurer can provide a constant glucose monitor (CGM), then he can monitor his glucose on a smart phone. Dexcom is probably the preferred brand, but Libre seems ok, too. Either way, you monitor the blood glucose levels enough to learn how to change the situation: Different food choices, eating more or less, estimating how much rapid insulin to administer for food, how much of an extra small correction needs to be made between meals, and very importantly, to avoid low glucose from too much insulin. \n\nModerate physical activity will soak up some of the glucose from muscle contractions. And once in a while, insulin and exercise takes too much glucose out of the blood, too rapidly. So, again, glucose monitoring is important to keep in a healthy range. He will get there soon enough, probably bumping up to a tad more insulin every couple of days, but that is for his doctors and nurses to tell you about. \n\nFood and snacks is an individualized taste and depends on how his body reacts. If you want to skip a lot of carbs to keep his glucose in a better range -- to avoid high spikes, then you can google ""low carb"" or ""keto"" and whatever food you want. Generally, proteins from eggs, meat, poultry, seafood, or plant proteins are fine -- they\'ll rais his glucose a little bit. Fat doesn\'t usually raise glucose by itself, but when combined with carbs, can cause higher blood glucose levels to linger longer. Carbs are generally from plants and it is recommended to eat more fresh foods, and less highly processed food (anything that includes added sugars, and lots of starches from wheat, corn, potatoes and rice). Fruit does contain a higher amount of sugar than vegetables, and tropical fruits tend to contain the most sugar, so you\'d want to be wary of their effect. Leafy greens and cruciferous veg are among the lowest carb vegetables, the more starch a food contains the higher the glucose will be affected. You can easily look up starchy vs. nonstarchy veg for a list. Look a the nutrition labels on packaged foods, and read the carbohydrates and servings per container. You\'ll learn soon enough. One day at a time. \n\nIf he exhibits any of the serious signs of DKA (vomitting, rapid breathing, confusion, severe belly pain), then probably should get him back to hospital. But if his ketone levels stay low and his glucose is below 250, then he will probably be just fine from here on. Good luck.', ""Fellow nzer here, but living in Aus. Diagnosed a year ago. 41mmol/l, ketones 4mmol/l. I was originally in the hospital 2 nights and then in endocrinologist/educator office 8am the morning I was out. 10 days is a bit crap.\n\nIt's normal for blood sugar to be a bit wonky in the first few weeks after diagnosis.\n\nI was regularly hovering 12- 15mmol/l and once or twice hit 20.\n\nIt's possible your husband's pancreas might still have enough function to last it out for another 10 days without a  bolus insulin. But chances are that it doesn't. \n\nIf that's the case then you've basically been given a knife in a gun fight with the lantus.\n\nThe plate method is going to be challenging without any rapid insulin if your husband's pancreas has lost most of its function. So, it's likely that the numbers will stay high if eating carbs.\n\n\nHigh blood sugar for another week or so isn't going to kill you, but if those ketones go up then it's straight to the ER. .6 is a safe range. Some people would be a little worried with ketones of 1mmol/l. I just checked https://www.diabetes.org.nz/type-1-diabetes-ketones. They recommend talking to your health care team urgently at 1.5mmol/l.\n\nSnacks. Walnuts, macadamia nuts. Cured meats. Tasty cheese with celery.

We ended up getting through to the nurse and she told us to up the lantus to 12 clicks instead of 8 if his blood sugars don’t come down a bit more tomorrow - Just had a readying of 22.3 2 hours after dinner the poor dude. \n\nWould be awesome if he could get a cgm as he’s a builder and I know stopping to prick will be a challenge for him! We will wait for the appointment to see what they say and suggest.\n\nAll the best :)', 'Thank you for taking the time to write out this reply it’s very insightful! You could get a job educating new diabetes patients at the hospital here!! 😂 \n\nYes he was diagnosed at a the hospital but they have sent his bloods off (c peptide) to determine wether it’s type 1 or type 2 but we will need to wait 2 weeks to find out. He has all the markers of type 1 but absolutely no genetic trace for it on either mum or dads side. But they think type one with 99% certainty. I think because he’s dropped almost 10 kilos in 2 weeks. \n\nWe have a appointment with his GP tomorrow so will discuss our concerns with them. Hoping they are knowledgeable about the best path forwards.\n\nWill look into the cgm as he’s really struggling to get blood from his fingers. He’s a builder with dermatitis so his hands are very dry and callused. I don’t believe it is public funded here in NZ but will look into his insurance and see if it’s possible to get because the finger prick is not easy for him if they can make exceptions. \n\nHonestly in the 7 years I’ve known him he’s probably been to the doctor 4-5 times and although his blood pressure has been high we have never had reason to test his sugars so can’t say he has ever failed tests before. We have noticed what we thought was low blood sugar a few times (shaky and needs something sweet to continue on) so possibly some signs when I think back.\n\nI’m currently 36 w pregnant and he’s been under a lot of stress with a new job so I feel like that’s really kicked things off in the last few weeks. We are netflixing and chill as much as possible now and so I hope the stress levels come down for him. \n\nToday we had readings between 17-30 mmol/L and ketones between 0.1-0.6 so based on the ketones alone we have assumed he’s okay for the night until we can get onto someone tomorrow. \n\nThanks again for all your insight', 'Thanks for your reply! Wow 41 \U0001fae3 today my husband was hovering between 20-30 even after upping the lantus clicks so we are really hoping tomorrow they can work out his insulin dosage to keep it on the downward track. We almost went to the hospital when we got the 30 but figured they can’t do much on a Sunday and he would likely just need to wait until the morning anyways… We will be calling his diabetes team first thing to try get an earlier appointment than Monday next week. His ketones are 0.1 - 0.5 so we are assuming that’s a good thing but honestly we are clueless. \n\nOmg the quest peanut butter cups thank you I will buy them asap. He loves chocolate and peanut butter so he will love these. Perfect for the tradies lunch box too. Thanks for the book recommendation will look into it. \n\nHope you are going well on your journey 🙏', 'Just FYI — The numbers you see people quoting here are either mmol/L or mg/dL (so the multiplying factor is 18, meaning 10 mmol/L - 180 mg/dL)\n\nAs far as genetics and T1D, there are a number of locations on the genome that researchers point to, especially in the regions called HLA genes. And they suspect several autoimmune diseases happen in the same area. But the combinations of genetic markers vary between people, and many people without diabetes carry the same markers — so genetics is considered a “predisposition” for most T1D, though some families do have lots of T1D across generations. But about 9:10 of new diagnoses have no close family relations with T1D. So, it’s not odd that your spouse might not have any known inheritance. Type 2 is more strongly associated with genetics. Wish we could say they know what else “triggers” T1D onset, but 100 years of research and they still decant find even one specific reason.']"

low fat whole plant vegan diet for type 2 diabetes,"Has anyone read books advocating high-carb low-fat whole food vegan diets to reverse type 2 diabetes? The two most well-known books seem to be ""mastering diabetes"" and books by neal bernard. Their theory is that insulin resistance is caused by fat gunking up the body and that a low fat diet will help remove the excess fat allowing insulin to work properly. 

But my question is why aren't low fat animal products okay then? Like for instance egg whites, fat-free diary, or even chicken breast?  how do these low fat or non-fat animal products add fat to the body. 

Also foods like lets say soybeans are recommended but that has more fat than egg whites so why is tofu okay but not egg whites?

So is it animal products or fat from any source plant or animal?

It’s because the body simply isn’t producing a lot of insulin to manage the food intake. This is completely different from pathological insulin resistance which is high insulin levels combined with the inability to clear glucose from the bloodstream. \n\nMy last a1c was 5.6 and I’m generally stable around that estimated average glucose. \n\nSome people claim that WFPB helps them.

We have shown evidence that fat can create diabetics in two hours (by fat infusion) (75) in two days (by fat meals) (76) or in three weeks (using a 65% corn oil diet). (77) In all three studies, there were no exceptions to the results: all subjects tested diabetic on glucose tolerance testing. With these subjects it was not necessary to check their histories for diabetic relatives--all that had to be noted was their fat intake.\n \n> Animals react to elevated fats in the diet with hyperglycemia, just as humans do. In a study with rabbits, (78) a diet with only 17% in fat was sufficient to bring the animals to a diabetic glucose tolerance test. The fat was primarily lecithin, derived from soy, so favored by many as a health supplement. Being a phospholipid, lecithin acts in the blood like any fat to create a diabetic hyperglycemia. \n\n> https://www.drmcdougall.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nathan-pritikin-review-of-medical-literature-1.pdf#page=432\n\nand so suffer all the negative effects of diabetes for hours despite not having chronic (type II) diabetes from [accumulation of fat in the cells](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-what-causes-insulin-resistance-diabetes/), that's how deeply linked fat is to diabetes.

Further, [cows milk](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apa.14756) is still a potential trigger for type 1 diabetes, yet people are saying animal products are perfectly fine - it should tell you something that people are on a diabetes forum pushing high fat diets despite all the evidence above which they really should be experts in and hilariously painting people accurately summarizing the scientific literature as 'advocates'.\n\nWhat is the safe minimum for fat?

You could theoretically wire your jaws shut preventing you from eating or take chemotherapy, etc... until you cure your T2DM, obviously these are not good ideas.\n\nThese dangerous low carb diets are in the realm of taking chemotherapy with similarly terrible side effects, not only do they not tell you that you will fail a postprandial (post-meal) oral glucose tolerance test and register as chemically diabetic following their diets, i.e. they do not admit they make even healthy people register as diabetic for hours after each meal, but they never tell you about other serious risks like the [risks to reproductive function](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1470393/1/Hardy_QRB15_starch.pdf)\n\n> Although a very high fat intake will prevent protein toxicity and provide energy for metabolism, it comes at the cost of high levels ketones in the blood, which can compromise reproductive function (Kim and Felig 1972). Traditional Arctic Inuit populations are known to have had a relatively low birth rate and a highly seasonal pattern of reproduction, which continued after widespread contact. \n\nor offspring viability\n\n> Glucose is the main energy source for fetal growth, and low glucose availability can compromise fetal survival (Herrera 2000; Baumann et al. 2002). Pregnant females have a minimal requirement for 70–130 g/day of preformed glucose or glucose equivalents to maintain optimum cognitive function in the mother and to nourish the fetus (Institute of Medicine 2006). Although increased gluconeogenesis is one of the first metabolic adaptations to pregnancy, maternal glucose levels decline in early pregnancy (Butte 2000; Metzker 2010; Thame et al. 2010). As pregnancy progresses, intrinsic insulin resistance develops in order to redirect glucose away from the mother and toward the growing fetus (Butte 2000). In healthy pregnant women, fetal growth is directly correlated with maternal glucose concentration (Metzger et al. 2009); larger infants are born to women with higher blood glucose (Butte 2000), while a link has been made between maternal gestational ketonemia and a reduced off-spring IQ (Rizzo et al. 1991). Tests of glucose deprivation in animals have repeatedly demonstrated a link between maternal glucose levels and offspring viability (Romsos et al. 1981; Taylor et al. 1983; Koski and Hill 1986). Offspring survival can also be affected by the increased demand for glucose during lactation. At peak lactation, mammary glands require an additional 70 g glucose/day for synthesis of lactose, the main sugar in milk (Institute of Medicine 2006).\n\nor [erectile dysfunction](https://www.phoenix.ca/blog/keto-and-ed-what-you-need-to-know) from chronically low [nitric oxide levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2728MP0De88) etc... etc...\n\nAny real success these people have is because of weight loss, and if you read my post on minimal fat needs above you will see how these diets should be the last thing people do to lose weight, it's like washing your muddy car with mud and expecting it to get clean - yes the wiping may clear the mud off and you might magically end up with a clean car that way, but most likely you're going to end up rubbing more mud over the car.

I'm in shock at my hbA1c (success story),"Hi all,

Long time lurker but wanted to say all the stories you have shared and information have helped me really process my diagnosis back in March this year.

I was diagnosed with a hbA1c of 82 mmol/mol (9.7%) in March after a collapse at home (went into hypertensive crisis). I've only just turned 30 and so reading up about Diabetes at that time really scared the life put of me. I was depressed for about a month and couldn't comprehend what to do with my life. As a new husband I was so ashamed and my wife and I really really struggled with this diagnosis.

Well that was the kick up the proverbial that I needed to get my health into shape. And I've just had my new hbA1c results come in from bloods taken yesterday and wanted to celebrate with the same community that has helped me through the highs and lows.

In March I was:
Weight: 120kg
HbA1c: 82 mmol/mol
Blood pressure: Stage 4 Hypertension

I took actions to medicate and change my lifestyle. I have been deadly serious and have moved to Metformin 1g AM and 1g PM, CICO dieting with calorie intake of 1200kcal/day, and lisinopril 7.5mg/day for Hypertension. My Hypertension is now under control for those worried, it is medicated but now in healthy range.

I had hbA1c blood repeated in April and it had come down to 61mmol/mol (7.7%). They regarded me as responding extremely well to Metformin at the early stage but I hadn't really started losing weight at that point, I was still figuring out lifestyle and what T2D meant.

Well I've stuck to these changes and had my hbA1c repeated yesterday 28th June.

I can now officially say my hbA1c is 36mmol/mol (5.4%) and I weighed myself this morning at 94kg.

I don't know what to say really. I'm in shock I guess. All these thoughts whizzing around my head now: is this remission territory, will they start looking at reducing medication (which I don't want), what's my long term fitness plan for Hypertension, is this sustainable, do I stop measuring instantaneous blood sugar. 

I'm truly amazed, and honestly it's this community that has helped keep me on the straight and narrow. Without you guys to keep me motivated when I've wanted to give up the diet, and give up much more than just that, it's your stories that have helped me. I couldn't have done it without you all and just wanted to share my love!

Is anyone else annoyed with the iLet *Artificial Pancreas* from Beta Bionics?,"Hey there, fellow T1D here, and I'm feeling a mix of confusion and annoyance. So, I stumbled upon this new iLet insulin pump, or as they like to call it, the ""artificial pancreas."" Can we talk about that for a moment?

I'm honestly interested to hear everyone's take on this. Personally, I find it completely reckless and irresponsible to label it as an artificial pancreas. They're marketing it as the first fully automated pump, claiming no carb counting is required. But seriously, that's far from the truth.

From what I've gathered, it appears that the system determines your bolus insulin based on some vague carb counting. You have to select whether you're consuming a normal, reduced, or increased amount of carbs. And to top it off, they even have a disclaimer that you must be ""carb aware."" Like, what does that even mean?

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for advancements in technology. As a Type 1 for 15 years, I've witnessed the progress we've made, and I'm optimistic about what the future holds. But this product, something about it just rubs me the wrong way. It's being hyped up as this revolutionary device, but honestly, it seems pretty damn similar to what's already out there. Is there somebody out there that is going to benefit from this product? Yes. Is it some otherworldly unheard of device? I’m going to say no.

I was also at ADA and DData (It was basically “DiabetesCon” in San Diego last weekend) where presentations were made by various BB executives. \n\nTBH, the type of people who are engaged in online diabetes communities are NOT who this pump is for. It’s for the person who is sick of even attempting to carb count, probably isn’t even using a pump yet, and wants something insanely simple that will still give them adequate results. \n\nKeep in mind that the average T1 in the US is still on MDI and not meeting targets for either A1c or TIR. We (collectively) are the outliers. \n\nMy personal experience: I came into the trial from using ControlIQ (with lots of overrides) and rocking a TIR of about 90%. I was randomized to using the iLet with Fiasp. My TIR went down and my A1c went up. I had to change cartridges/sets more frequently due to the limited capacity (180u). I had to adjust the high alarm setting on my Dexcom because it was going off so much more frequently than I was used to. To say it was frustrating would be an understatement. \n\nAll that aside, I understand that I am not the target demographic for this system. And my experience in the trial was the impetus that kicked off my research into insulin sensitivity dynamics (which led to the DynamicISF algorithm in AAPS and iAPS), so I can’t say that nothing good came of it.', ""I'm sure they chose the name years ago when they had high ambitions.

It won’t be here tomorrow, or even next year, but it WILL happen.', ""How does it work without a meal announcement? There's such a delay from my CGM that if I took insulin when my BG started to rise I'd always be behind."", 'A combination of a couple of things: \n\nIt tries pretty aggressively to “catch up” when a meal is detected, projecting where BG is headed and bolusing for THAT rather just bolusing for the rise that’s already happened, and…\n\nIt takes into account the changes in insulin sensitivity caused by the rise in BG, so when spikes do happen (this isn’t a “never out of range” scenario- it’s expected that an unannounced meal may send you a bit high), it attenuates them more quickly. There’s basically an intentional over bolus followed by suspending once BG starts to drop. The new math for estimating sensitivity allows the system to better evaluate the effects of the insulin in real time, so you can be more aggressive, but do so safely. \n\nMost (if not all) that I’ve spoken to are using Lyumjev, which is enough faster than Humalog to make a meaningful difference. \n\nPersonally, I announce meals whenever possible since I’m stuck with  Humalog (No Lyumjev from my insurer). But even there with just the announcement, I’m usually 90%+ in range. I did have a mild low last Saturday after eating an entire day’s worth of calories in a single meal, shooting up to the mid-high 200s and then coming back down, but it only dropped to the mid-60s, stayed there for an hour or so, and then came back up on its own. \n\nBasically, I think it’s reasonable to anticipate that with standard rapid-acting insulins, we can push TIR over 80% in FCL mode, and using even faster insulins, high 80s or even low 90s are achievable. If you announce meals, high 80s become the baseline expectation with the standard “‘logs” and mid-90s are reasonable to expect with ultra-rapids. \n\nThe key to the whole thing is that it discards the standard “diabetes math” in favor of new equations derived from studying how well-controlled T1s actually dose their corrections in real life.', ""Yep, I have to dose 20-30 minutes ahead to see no spike, CGM Data is something like 15-20 minutes behind. I know what it's like to forget to dose until after (or even the middle of) a meal, that's going to be terrible control. I think fiasp or another insulin faster than humalog might help, but it still wouldn't be as good as dosing ahead of time."", 'Cool, thanks for your input! Very interesting :)']"

Diabetes as a result of pituitary gland tumour?,"My boyfriend was diagnosed with a prolactinoma in early 2020. Now he is diabetic. 

He is a big guy and was weighing at 350lbs in March. He then dropped almost 70lbs since March and had a DKA a few weeks ago. 

The doctors aren’t even certain on his type of diabetes; they just know he needs insulin. His C-Peptide was normal but on the lower end of normal. His anti insulin antibody was positive for antibodies. Family doctor says yes to type 1, endo says not sure about that yet let’s do the anti GAD test and test your ACTH and parathyroid levels and get a CT scan. We live in Canada so nothing happens fast around here so who knows how long it’ll take to get a CT appointment. His endo also told him to WAIT until the week before their 3 month follow up to do the bloodwork so that it’s all recent at the appointment. 

It feels like we’re just kind of stuck in limbo. Of course I start googling why the doctor would want these things done and I’m lead down a rabbit hole of MEN1 and pancreatic cancer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14mdrci/diabetes_as_a_result_of_pituitary_gland_tumour/,"['One can have anti-insulin antibodies and not have Type 1 — for example, some people develop them in response to insulin injections, according to reports.

But again, reports indicate that can happen to some T2D, as well. I only had one C-peptide done about 3.5 yrs after diagnosis, and it was low-normal, but sort of “stimulated” by food I ate before hand, so it should have been higher. \n\nHormonal/endocrine disorders can have significant impact on glucose — ie. low testosterone, adrenal tumor, pancreatic tumor. I don’t know about the pituitary one. My mom has had one for many years and it presses on her right optic nerve, near the optic chiasm, so she is having vision problems. She had an operation once but is elderly and not sure whether she should again or not. She has no hormonal issues from hers though.

I just got done at the doctor's office to talk about my diabetes. Here's what happened.,"I just got done at the doctor's office. 
My doctor started the appointment by saying I will have to see a Diabetic educator which will be scheduled at a later date. He then told me he was going to put me on Metformin with me taking one pill a day first week, 2 a day second week, 3 a day third week and all subsequent weeks. 

I asked him again what the test results were because the nurse told me and I forgot. 
He said my blood sugar was 271 instead of 100. He also said my A1C was 10.7. I told him since I was diagnosed Monday, I've had no sweets or sugary drinks.

Doctor told me to come back 3 months to do some more blood work. I asked about glucometer and strips and he told me he'd be happy to prescribe them to me. I also asked about a c peptide test and the doctor told me I didn't need one. Told me I wasn't lacking insulin. Lastly, I asked about an injection of Ozempic once a week and he told me I only needed it if I thought I needed it. 

Overall, the visit went good.  I feel better than I did on Monday when I first got diagnosed.  Here's hoping things work out and I can keep my diabetes under control.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14larfj/i_just_got_done_at_the_doctors_office_to_talk/,"[""> I also asked about a c peptide test and the doctor told me I didn't need one.

Metformin can have some uncomfortable side effects, mainly abdominal pain and diarrhea. Just be aware of it and don\'t trust any farts and you\'ll likely be fine. For me (and this doesn\'t mean you\'ll be the same) I had some abdominal discomfort and frequent bathroom trips for the first couple of weeks and then my body just adjusted to it. \n\n\nBe prepared that you may not progress as quickly as you\'d like. It took me almost a month to get my BG levels into an acceptable range on Janumet (it\'s a Januvia Metformin mix) and that was with me basically eating only proteins and non starchy vegetables.\n\n> I told him since I was diagnosed Monday, I\'ve had no sweets or sugary drinks.\n\n\nIt isn\'t just the obvious ""sweets"" and ""sugary drinks"" that you need to worry about. Carbohydrates and Starches turn into glucose. So breads, pastas, noodles, rice, etc. Diabetes doesn\'t mean you can never have those things, but do so in moderation and of course check your BG regularly. Anytime I eat something that I\'m ""testing"" to see how I react. I\'ll have the meal and test my BG 1 hour after and then 2 hours after. When I have Pad Thai (Thai noodle dish) my BG will spike in the first hour...like from 100 to 184 then after 2 hours I\'ll be back down under 120. \n\n\nSo I was diagnosed in early April. My BG at the time was 506ish and when I tested my A1C the next day it was 11.4. It took about a month on metformin to get my BG levels in the Normal (90-150) range.\n\n\nNow I told you to watch out for Carbohydrates, but the good news is there are some exceptions. Sweet Potatoes have been my friend.\nI only recently started tolerating rice, but you can try substituting brown rice instead of white (or fried) rice. Brown Rice is a complex carb so it processes into sugar more slowly allowing your body to keep up with the sugar intake better. Black beans are another on. The mexican restaurant near me does refried black beans...that\'s become one of my favorites. Quest Nutrition has alot of products (peanut butter cookies, reese\'s style peanut butter cups, protein bars, etc) that are less than 1g of sugar and typically less than 5g of carbohydrates. I\'ve found that these have helped me curb my sweet tooth without blowing all my hard work. \n\n\nAnother thing to watch out for. About a week after I started metformin my eyes felt like I\'d been staring at a computer screen for 3 days straight. Metformin can sometimes cause a B12 deficiency...I can\'t confirm that that is what happened with me because I didn\'t have a blood test to confirm it, but I started taking a good multivitamin and a B12 supplement and I haven\'t had a problem since.', ""> Told me I wasn't lacking insulin\n\nAs evidenced by what?

The more intensive the better, but anything is better than nothing.  Brisk walking, jogging, all the way up to high intensity interval training, as well as resistance training and aerobic exercise are all good.  Exercise stimulates the uptake of glucose by moving alot of glucose transporters to the cell membranes of skeletal muscle and the effect lasts up to 2 days from last exercise.\n\nAlso, eating a low carb. diet is helpful.  If there's excess glucose, just makes sense to not give the body a normal amount of new glucose to attend to.\n\nImplement these things, if you aren't doing them, will likely lower the A1C significantly in the first month, let alone in the 2-3 months it takes to 'reset'."", 'Get yourself a good endocrinologist.', 'My endo took the c peptide and antibody.

I'm on Mounjaro now, and that works. It's also great for weight loss. Those injectables (Victoza, Mounjaro, Ozempic, Wegovy) can make you a bit queasy, but that's sort of how they work. They can also slow the emptying of stomach contents, and that messes with blood sugar readings if you take insulin for meals, so just be aware.

Vegetarian recipes for diabetics!,"Hello All!

I’m new to this sub - I’m not a diabetic but my mother is. I’m looking for any food suggestions/cookbooks/recipes for a vegetarian diabetic because we are at our wits end on what she should eat. 

She’s been diabetic for 15+ years and is currently at a good weight (she lost a lot of weight about 8 years ago). We are south Asian and so her diet consists of a lot of carbs (rice, potatoes, etc) and I’m trying to get her to eat more protein heavy and nutritious foods and veggies. But even I’m at a loss for some new ideas.

Feeling a bit bummed after the doc today - Meds didn't change,"March 27th of this year I went to the hospital feeling very ill.

I'm on:

* Metformin twice daily
* Lantus 35 mg at night
* Ozempic 1mg once a week

"New to this, looking for advice.","Hello! I (f34) have recently been diagnosed adult onset type 1 diabetic. I was very very poorly but put it down to the stress of caring for my terminally ill mother, but turns out I was actually quite bad and my pancreas is not making any insulin (as far as I understand it?). 
I'm on insulin jabs now and have to change my entire life it seems! I'm just a bit overwhelmed and confused. 
I'm in the UK so my meds are free, which is great, but the NHS is under a lot of strain and I'm not able to access the help I need with diet advice and all the other stuff just yet. 
I'm doing a lot of research myself but it's really difficult for me to wrap my head around all this stuff and it's not always very easy to understand, especially when there's a lot of conflicting info online. 
Basically I just have some questions for anyone who has been through this and can give me advice. 
I've done what I can diet wise, cutting out sugar and a lot of the carbs I'm used to eating, but is that the right thing to do? Should I be eating no carbs? 
Does my blood glucose monitor reading have any effect on what I can and can't eat that day? (for example when it's lower can I eat some of the stuff I've been avoiding?) 
Do I need to start eating meals at set times? (I'm someone who just eats when I'm hungry, also super busy so set meals is hard) 
Is snacking okay in between insulin doses? 
Is the jab site supposed to be so itchy? 
Can the insulin be out of the fridge if I'm going out to eat? (they said I must take it directly before meals) 
Can stress effect my BG? 

For some background, I am over weight but have lost a fair amount recently (apparently that was a symptom). I don't drink or take drugs. I vape. I love sugar 😢 lol. My BG is consistently high (like 14mmol is the lowest I go, 24mmol the highest although I was over 30mmol when I was diagnosed in the hospital). I'm on 12 insulin twice a day (they said they will start me slow and go up over time, I started on 8)
I do feel slightly better already (it's been 10 days) but I'm so tired. 

I'm sorry this is a lot of info! Thanks so much if you read it all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14m3zee/new_to_this_looking_for_advice/,"[""There is a lot to learn, but it will come with time. Focus on the basics of checking your glucose and taking your insulin. You can work on the details later.\n\n1. Cutting carbs: There is no need to cut carbs/sugars entirely. Most T1s don't. The amount of carbs you eat will dictate the amount of bolus (fast) insulin you take. You should use an insulin:carb ratio. Mine is 1:10, or 1 unit of novorapid for every 10g of carbs I eat. A sandwich would be roughly 30g of carbs, so I would take 3 units. \n2. Your glucose readings will have some bearing on what you eat. If your glucose is high, then eating a lot of carbs might not make much sense, as this will send your glucose higher. The best approach would be to take some insulin to correct and wait a bit before eating. As for being low, generally I would advise against using lows to treat yourself. The amount of sugar we need to correct a low is often not much. So it's very common to over treat and go high after. \n3. Set meal times are not needed. But you might let us know what insulin you are using. Your long acting insulin should carry your glucose nice and steady while not eating. When we eat we take fast insulin to cover it.\n4. Snacking between insulin doses is hard. But eating something low carb is ok. You could take some insulin to have your snack. Your doses of fast insulin shouldn't be at set times, they should be taken when we eat, whatever time that is. \n5. Insulin can be out of the fridge for a long time. If you read the pamphlet that comes with it, it will recommend you keep the pen you are using out of the fridge entirely."", 'Welcome to the club no one wants to be part of! Here are some things I wish someone had told me when I was first diagnosed (I was 26, also after a period of intense stress and illness.)\n\n1. Pro level tip, go read ""Think Like a Pancreas"". It will set you up for long term success, even if you move to a pump. \n2. You should be on 2 types of insulin - long acting (which you take once a day) and short acting (which you take a meals or to reduce your blood sugars.) Learn about both, and how to use the latter to keep yourself healthy. \n3. You can inject (jab) in a few different locations. Make sure to move the spot, stomach is typically best, but there are other areas. \n4. Finger sticks. Go buy a good lancet. Typically the one you get from the ER/Endo/Dr is trash and painful. I like the Accucheck Soft-Clix. Test often. When  was on MDI I would check 20+ times a day. A CGM will make that easier, and should be a conversation you have with your endo. \n5. Weight loss and diabetes can be different. Insulin makes your body want to hold on to fat (the fat you are trying to loose...) but it can work. High protein, low carb/fat diet is key. I\'m like you and busy most of the day, so having snacks like beef jerkey, pickles, etc. at the ready is always key. \n6. Diet soda/drinks, low cab versions of foods you like. That was a tough one for me, as I was a soda junkie and I still love cereal. Now, it\'s Mt. Dew Zero and Magic Spoon cereal instead of Dew and Trix. \n7. Be patient with yourself. It takes time to figure this out - you\'ll get there. \n\nOn the vaping thing I\'ll leave 2 thoughts. I vape, typically 0MG and I find that it\'s helpful to keep my sweet tooth at bay. Sometimes I will use 3mg juice (which is really low) but as with anything you inhale - it can be bad for your lungs, and if your diabetes is out of control it will play hell with your system.', 'The other reply is spot on. Bottom line is you will now manage your needs directly and will start understanding carbohydrate - insulin requirements. In the end you may be healthier than you’ve been in quite a while. You should regain some energy, too. Great luck and stay in this Reddit as the people here are awesome.', 'How were you diagnosed as Type 1 — via autoantibody tests? What was your glucose/A1C when you got diagnosed?\n\nYour pancreas probably still produces some insulin — but will make less and less over the years. \n\nWhat brand(s) of insulin do you have? I was fine on just 5 units to start 8+ years ago, but this week have been up to 50 units per day. Big change for me. \n\nWhat to eat is an individualized question. It depends on what you prefer, and how your body responds. Each person here manages differently. A raw vegan and a carnivore dieter might have similar outcomes with very different approaches. But generally, avoiding sugary beverages is a great start, and reducing junky food intake (with added sugars and highly-processed l, powdered starches from wheat and grains, potatoes, rice, and corn). These will cause high spikes of glucose and offer not much in the way of nutrition that you couldn’t also get from a cup of broccoli, for example. Other better choices for plant nutrients are gonna be leafy greens, nonstarchy veg, and olives/avocados maybe for healthy natural fats. Beans and nuts are per person choice as they can have differing effects. Tropical fruits, and especially dried fruits and fruit juices, are going to flood your system with higher blood sugar. \n\nProtein is necessary, but some protein is converted to glucose over hours. Fat has little direct effect on blood glucose, but fat content can prolong higher glucose. And so pizza and chinese food will require a series of correction doses for people taking faster insulin at mealtime.\n\nThere are people who believe it is healthier to reasonably restrict food (to avoid highs, to avoid over medicating by accident, to avoid weight gain); and there are those who think it is rational to enjoy your life as anyone would, and that it is possible to count carbs and dose. nd make corrections as needed. You won’t really get too many honest opinions about the full picture, though. Insulin and excess food can cause to more weight gain, making insulin less effective. People do dose for carbs and make errors or experience sudden changes. \n\nDiabetic patients do get pretty good results with low carb eating and medication — proven by many kinds of reports. But they don’t always stick to low carb, and low carb has certain side effects that need compensation (hydration, electrolytes). Vegans and vegetarians may also become more flexible. But all “diets” have similar concerns and compensations that need to be made. People who are adamant that there is one “right” way are often new to the game or may have an “activist” kind of mentality associated with their intentions. And people saying “eat whatever you want” — do you really know what their body is going through? No, so your journey is an individual experience and can be a little lonely, so then you just find others and have your say.\n\nI would recommend lower carb intake, but my life is not at all the same as others. \n\nIt’s terrified that you are. wing so proactive, and communicating with doctors, and also learning on your own. It is a lot to learn, like a whole world inside your own body that you never had to think about before. It is very interesting, but boredom and sometimes inexplicable difficulties can wear on a person. It is common for burn out and low mood to hit people from time to time. So, if you are looking for one answer that produces consistent results, that is going to be a little hard to find among honest people. One day at a time.

Health Anxiety,"I’ve been posting on here a lot recently cause I really need some support.  
I feel like everyone in my life is so tired of hearing me talk about my diabetes, but everyday I’m terrified I’m not doing the right things, and at the drop of a hat I could have one of the many complications that come along with having diabetes. A heart attack, a stroke, kidney failure, I could wake up tomorrow and my vision is worse, my neuropathy has traveled father up my leg, any of the many complications. 
Even though I’ve got my A1C down to 5.5 I’ve had almost a straight week of my numbers being higher than I would like them to be. Even if my A1C is down that doesn’t mean that the string of high numbers I’ve been having lately couldn’t not cause complications, right? 
I literally went to a concert today and had an amazing time, until I got back to the car and had to remind myself “I need to check my glucose before I drive home in case I’m low, that’d be dangerous.” Just to find out I’m once again higher than I’d like to be. I had 1 and a half sugar free rock-stars today and my lip is twitching right now, I’m sure it’s just from having too much caffeine but I’ve convinced myself I could be having a stroke. 
My doctor says he wants me to live a happy and healthy life but how am I supposed to do that when I’m so damn terrified I could have a life-threatening event at any moment because my chances are at least 10x higher than any of my friend’s? 
I have no insurance and already almost over $1,000 in medical debt because of this disease which makes the health anxiety 10x worse because if I do have a life-threatening event I feel I might figure to put it off and then actually die.

Anyone deal with brain fog with diabetes?,"Not just brain fog, I guess, but I'm not sure what else to call it that is short enough for a title. I was just diagnosed (type 2) a couple weeks ago, more or less out of the blue. My A1C was fine for, well, forever (checking every six months), until suddenly it was an 8. Not the worst it could be, I guess, but bad enough to take seriously.

Anyway, until I started diet changes and metformin, I was feeling like absolute shit for months. Didn't even realize how bad until it started to get better. Notably, I was exhausted every afternoon, to the point of having trouble staying awake at my desk. Could barely think. I do feel better now, a few weeks into managing this--not perfect, but progress.

What caught my attention, though, and made me make this post, is that I just realized another likely effect of the diabetes. I've always been an avid reader; here on Reddit, I participate in the /r/52book subreddit, where you do the annual challenge to read a certain number of books in the year. And I realized I have been in the worst reading slump of my life, for...about five or six months (though it was building before that). And suddenly this week, when my fasting glucose has finally dropped consistently into the 130s, I find I have the motivation to read again. Finished my first book since January, and for the first time in months it wasn't a struggle. And it kills me to say that this was probably the reason, but the timing just seems undeniable.

A bit freaked out,"I know I'm most likely overreacting, so apologies if this is a topic you've all seen a bunch before. 


I'm in my late twenties, and over the past few annual checkups, my a1c has consistently stayed at 6.0 to 6.1, which had my doc start me on 500mg/day metformin recently to see if it, plus lifestyle changes help get it back under a prediabetic range. Overall, I know I shouldn't be as freaked out as I am, (both parents were type 1 diabetics, so it was something I've been worried about for a while), but it's one of those things where I can't stop kicking myself about it. 

I've been overweight most of my life, with a high current BMI (190cm 140kg/6'3"" 330lbs) that I'm currently working on. I've been working on a healthier relationship with food, and an attempt to curb the ""munchies binges"" I've had. 

All things considered I know I'm lucky to have made it this far without worse issues sooner, but I can't shake the feeling of ""I should have/could have done X"". I feel like I've failed somehow. 

Most of my experience with diabetes is that of growing up with my parents over 20 years ago, and I lost one of them to pancreatic cancer. I know management techniques, medication, and prognosis have improved since then, but I wanted to know if you have any tips to help deal with the anxiety about it. There's still a lot I don't know about diabetes, and I don't want to freak myself out too much by doomscrolling.

Was diagnosed T2 recently but referred to endocrinologist for 'other things'...,"I thought I would've got my diagnosis and that would be that. I'm being treated with Metformin as standard for T2 and changing my diet and exercise habits, however my case was directed over to the endo unit at the hospital.

"Recent Diagnosis, a little terrified","Hi, i hope y'all are going well! :)

I was absolutely devastated but I'm trying to deal with it. 

I was wondering about remission and if it's an achievable goal. Has anyone over here managed to do it and stay in remission? What did the process look like for y'all?

Type 2 and ADHD,"Anyone else have type 2 and ADHD?  I know this post is quite niche but I am beginning to suspect my ADHD is playing a role in me not being able to keep my sugars down.

Problem 1: Sensory Issues

My sensory issues are preventing me from getting the exercise I want and need to keep my sugars down.  I am very sensitive to heat (I can feel a temperature increase of 1 degree) to even going for walks is impossible for me in the summer months.  Yet, going to the gym (with its lovely AC) bores the hell out of me.  Likely the best exercise choice for me is swimming but I have body image issues and it is hard to motivate myself to go when I'm going to beat myself up the entire time.  I'm just being honest.  These are my struggles.  Does anyone else have this issue?  Any ideas about how I can overcome it?

Problem 2: Impulsivity

Any sign of stress and I'm hungry.  I'm finally recognizing that I've been using food as a soothing technique my entire life and it's obviously a problem.  I don't gorge on food or anything.  I just snack on inappropriate things.  Also, if I've had a hard day, the healthy meal I have planned for dinner goes out the window and I'll eat fast food.  I firmly believe that eating healthy doesn't have to be boring or unflavourful but those sweet, sweet carbs keep filling my need for dopamine.

Problem 3: Lack of Awareness

Sometimes, I am eating and not even realizing it.  So, when my sugars are higher (they're never VERY high, usually in the 8-9 range) when I feel like I've been eating healthy, I lose perspective on everything.  I also lose motivation.

&#x200B;

My sugars aren't terrible but I want to do better.  I don't want to increase my meds again, especially when I feel like it's a moral failing.

I also have anxiety though, so working out with someone is helpful and helps it not be as boring. I also eat when I'm tired (I'm not on stimulants) so I've switched to nuts and seeds and popcorn for snacks. Water bottle with a straw for increasing fluids. And most importantly, find balance. I totally had a blueberry muffin the other day but I had protein prior to it and my numbers didn't jump as high as it normally would have. Find your safe foods and keep them on hand.

Pre-work out Meals,"Hi folks,

Just after some good meal/snack ideas before doing a work out. After a couple of stints with GDM and a recent T2 diagnosis, I've been needing to eat before working out - I usually do it fasted.

Today, I was running behind in getting my daughter to school on time and so I had a small can of baked beans (SPC - Aussie here) about an hr before class and man did it floor me. Dizziness and nausea about half way through. 

Now this is my go to since I also have anemia and I've never had this issue be it work or gym so I'm thinking it's time to rethink the beans. My dietitian says I should drop the high iron food for now just to get back into the rhythm of eating as a diabetic but those cans are damn convenient... I haven't enjoyed many protein/museli bars but if there's one that you absolutely swear by I would welcome the recommendation.

Cheers in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14lt9d2/prework_out_meals/,"['Personally, I boil hard eggs.

Instead of baked beans, which can be heavy on the stomach, try lighter options such as a small banana with a handful of almonds or a slice of whole grain toast with nut butter.

These bars are typically made with natural ingredients and have a balanced nutritional profile. However, it's important to check the carbohydrate content and choose options that align with your diabetes management plan. \nRemember, it's always best to consult with your dietitian or healthcare provider for personalized advice. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me in a direct message."", 'This is a stellar idea.', ""Thanks for the info! \n\nI take the smallest tins which have 14g of total carbs which is within my 15g/snack plan.

Five months ago I went to my GP and my A1c was 7.9. She increased my Ozempic to 2mg From 1mg. I also had been taking Metformin 1000mg x2, and glipizide 5Mg. After 3 months there was no change in A1c.   
I am now taking the Ozempic, 10 mg of Glipizide in the am, and 5 at night. My bs doesn’t rise from my dinner until bedtime, several hours after eating and the night time glipizide works to a point, and then the bs just starts to rise higher and higher continuing after I wake. It takes until late afternoon before I get down to the 110’s.   


Why is this happening all of a sudden? Are there any other meds I should be considering? The only other med I’ve taken was Jardiance with bad effects. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14lbkku/medications_barely_working_all_of_a_sudden/,"['Great questions for your doctor.', ""Give yourself some time to recover, you just finished your cancer treatment. It's likely that it affected your bg and insulin sensitivity.\n\nBest of luck to you."", 'Did you have any chemo?

I did get lots of IV fluids though but they were just saline.\n\nThey never told me steroids would make it hard/impossible to control my bg, It was just a constant fight with insulin corrections until my bg was in range']"
(27m) Should I be doing more than i currently am doing?,"So I (27m) was relatively recently diagnosed with type two diabetes with a A1C of 8.9 and a glucose lv of 170 after fasting at early June of this year. Since then, I have been changing up my diet and lifestyle in order to lower both such as exercising more and eating less sugars and carbs. I also take metaformin twice a day. 

When I wake up, i generally have a glucose lv of between 120-150ish depending on what I ate last night. I have been more careful of what I eat, but as an asian who grew up eating white rice for almost every meal, I have forced myself to only eat 1 cup of rice maybe 2 times a week of brown/white rice mix. I have stopped eating sugary foods such as candy and juice. That being said I have been cheating in order to break up the monotony by eating foods such as chicken cutlets (air-fried), stir fry with fake sugar (monk-fruit), and sometimes canned tomato sauce (with no added sugar).    

In terms of exercise, I have been following my doctor's recommendation of 150 minutes of exercise per week. To do that I have been following along this 15 min video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtXZy7yVt-g&list=LL&index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtXZy7yVt-g&list=LL&index=2)) my sister uses for her own exercise that she sent me + 7 more minutes of using my family's elliptical machine every day. The video used to leave me hard breathing, but now leaves me winded and slightly sweaty while the elliptical machine (which burns me around 100 calories) afterwards is usually enough to leave me dying of breath and sweating. Afterwards after resting, I usually eat some salted peanuts (around 1-2 cups worth) and some fruit (apples, grapes, cherries, peaches). 

Is there anything I need to do more or not do at all?  Should I take out something from my diet? Should I be doing more exercise? Is the type of exercise I am doing not good enough?

"Your daily routine, lifestyle change, devices you use at home & at a lab","Hi everyone, 

My dad is having some issues with high cholesterol and possible pre-diabetics (at a risk level of H1AC), we're looking into how we can take care of him best. He is fairly young (in his early 50s) and overall had a relatively high BMI ever since I've known him. I wanted to ask this community to see what everyone's daily routines are like. 

For example, just from your personal experience, how often do you get tested, do you get tested through your clinical lab or do a quick home diagnostic test (if so, what do you use usually), have you made any drastic lifestyle changes, if so what were they (for example - exercise frequency, types of exercise, intensity). Has it been very hard for you to interpret your health diagnostic results? Do you usually have a clinician or a doctor to consult you with your current health data? We live in Asia but my dad moves around to the US from time to time, hence, why I want to get more involved with him if he's far away, at least to keep track of biometrics (cholesterol and sugar level) to see if he's on track to get healthier. I am a somewhat data-driven person, so seeing real-time progress of his biometrics and seeing any correlation will be helpful but not sure if that's something that I should be focusing on.  What have everyone's biggest challenges been and how have you been navigating through them?

I know I'm coming here all of a sudden with lots of questions, and have been really trying to navigate through all this with lots of online resources, but really curious about how others have been dealing with it. My dad and I don't have the best communication so it's hard to know what he's thinking or what's bothering him but would love to be there for him if he gets confused.

Dexcom G7 questions?,"Pain level of insertion with the 7

I use the G6 for three years, with it only being FDA approved in the belly. I struggled so much with using it to the point I cancelled my prescription and let a whole set of transmitters and sensors go bad-and haven’t used it for 2/3 years since. 

The G7 just became available to me and I’m considering getting it and my doctor told me they are FDA approved for the arm now so I’m wondering how people feel about the pain level is insertion on the G6 versus the G7?

I am very overweight particularly in my stomach due to other health problems, but not in the arms, my legs and arms are pretty toned. Do you think the insertion needle going not so far into sub Q tissue will help with pain?

As well, they were being inserted on stretch marks because I have no other option for that area and my doctor said because it was not FDA approved to put on the arm she couldn’t legally give me the medical advice to put on arm.

Mini rant here of g6: I would sit for probably 20 to 40 minutes to even an hour sometimes debating if I even want to do in certain or try to rip it off after the adhesive on cause I just couldn’t pull the trigger. I have many piercings, and to me even that pain is less than what a G6 insertion was. It was like a gunshot 10/10. I also had a lot of issues with number readings being accurate, so I just decided it’s not worth all the pain if it’s not even gonna work. 

As well many of the insertion devices I had with the G6 were early models as I got on it right when it came out and the buttons, the little orange one would grind plastic and struggle to press the spring to try to press it down so I think there was some quality control issues, making it even harder to press the button.

Does anyone have experience teaching English or living in Vietnam with T1D?,"I'm looking into teaching English in Vietnam and there doesn't seem to be a ton of info on managing T1D there. 

It seems like you can buy insulin only with a prescription - is that easy to get in Vietnam? 

I also read that both the Freestyle Libre and glucose testing supplies are available over the counter. I've also read that the medicine is cheaper than it is in the US even without insurance. Would paying for it all out of pocket be doable?

Lastly - is it easy to get a job? I've heard that there's some discrimination.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14kvsdw/does_anyone_have_experience_teaching_english_or/,"[""I taught in Thailand for about two years, so not Vietnam, but I can still give my experience on managing there. Thailand is slightly more developed than Vietnam, though Vietnam is definitely catching up.\n\n**Insulin** \\- I was able to buy over the counter in Thailand without a prescription at drug stores, but not all pharmacies carry insulin. They carry Novorapid penfill and a long-acting type (not sure which because it didn't apply to me). Hospitals also sell it, but more expensive, especially at private hospitals. I would buy a months supply for about $50, but I don't use much insulin. Private hospitals were expensive at like $150. If it requires a prescription, just go to a doctor and prove you have diabetes, you should be able to get a prescription. It might be best to start with a private, international hospital first - in Thailand, those doctors will often speak English because they have studied abroad.\n\n**Doctors** \\- There's not much individual self-management of diabetes and my first appointment was spent reviewing carb counting, insulin ratios, etc. It was bizarre because all I needed was supplies and prescriptions (I went to the doctor before I learned I didn't need a prescription to buy insulin).\n\n**Supplies** \\- I shipped Dexcom, test strips, and my pump supplies from the US, as I was under 26 and still on parent's insurance. Insulin pumps, Dexcom, and Freestyle are not commonly used in SE Asia at all except by wealthier people. Since I didn't really buy supplies there, I can't knowledgeably discuss whether it's more or less than the US.\n\n**Insurance** \\- your job should have an insurance option or you need to buy your own. In Thailand, they discriminate for pre-existing conditions. Again...I don't actually know, but they might just cover the basics for diabetes care (test strips, glucose meter, and insulin) versus Freestyle Libres, pump supplies, etc.\n\n**Cost** \\- expect to pay more. It all depends on salary and what you need. I met a couple other Type 1's who got by on just insulin shots and I think cost-wise, that's doable. If you want a pump or CGM, you might need to budget more. Cost of living is way lower, but so are salaries. Also, the salary range is large - a teacher in international schools can make great money, private schools can do well, and govt school salaries are enough to get by and treat oneself, but harder to do long term as you need to budget for flights home, retirement, etc.\n\n**Jobs** \\- Yes, discrimination exists against people of color, even if they are native speakers. A lot of places want a white teacher. There's still opportunities for people to teach English though and it can depend on the individual school. Jobs are pretty plentiful. In Thailand, a degree of any sort is needed. Not sure requirements in Vietnam.\n\nMy recommendation if you go through with it is this:\n\n1. Teach in a city to start (HCM or Hanoi...but HCM for a T1 diabetic would be easier I think)\n2. Bring supplies to start you off. Be prepared to go without a Libre.\n3. Budget extra, you will have to. Non-diabetics aren't paying for supplies.\n4. You can always go home - health is first. \n\nPersonally, I left Thailand due to the difficulties of managing Type 1 (and I also have celiac disease, which is another nightmare in Asia). I had the benefit of being on my parent's insurance at that time, but living without Dexcom and my pump is something I cannot do. It's literally added years to my life. So I made the difficult decision to leave. I'm sure it's doable....but quality of life must be taken into consideration and whether that's worth it. Even though the US healthcare is fucked up, I am able to get the supplies I need through my work's insurance fortunately, though it does cost a lot. So there's a lot of layers.

My hunch is that  you'd be able to survive fine but not really save up much for retirement / flights home if you lived there long-term, but a short-term (1-2 years) might work if you don't need to save.

Experiences with metformin for prediabetes/ very early type 2?,"Hi,

I have been prescribed 500 mg of metformin once a day by my GP.

Basically, my fasting glucose a week ago was 7.08 mmol/L, which was in diabetic range but then later my OGTT was 5.39 for fasting and 2 hours later 9.42 mmol/L.

My doctor finally diagnosed me with prediabetes and prescribed metformin 500 mg once a day today. I took the first dose today and have had some bad case of the toilet runs and excess gas. Granted I'm also on my second day of my periods so I cannot tell if it's purely the metformin.

My stomach settled a little in the evening after some sushi.

 I'm 27 years old and I've had some poor diet/sedantary lifestyle and together with my PCOS and family history I think I developed this Insulin Resistance.

I'm supposed to take the same dose for 3 months and later go back for another blood work after. I have also been advised to make changes to my lifestyle as well.


My question is, what has your experience been with metformin? This is my first time ever on any medication and I know metformin is prescribed for PCOS as well, but I'm reading online and a LOT of people are taking about very bad adverse side effects like kidney failure and such and it's scaring me so much.

My idea is to take it for 3 months and then stop once my blood work comes back a little normal and keep continuing to maintain it with diet and exercise. Is that something feasible? Has anyone on this sub been successful?

I'm really scared about this. Can anyone recommend any supplements that can counteract any adverse effects? My doctor did not even tell me about any side effects when i asked her so I'm really worried.

I know this is online (and therefore inherently self-contradictory), but please. Stop. Most people are not diagnosed with diabetes via routine screening. It’s more often the case that they have had undiagnosed/uncontrolled diabetes for years, and it gets caught incidentally during a visit for some other complaint. High blood pressure is the big thing that damages kidneys, and untreated hypertension usually walks hand-in-hand with untreated diabetes (and cholesterol problems). Many people who start metformin  ALREADY have pre-existing kidney damage, and are on the road to kidney failure. Metformin is one of the safest and most-prescribed medications on the planet. Yes, the GI side effects can be unpleasant, but they usually go away (or at least improve) as the body gets used to the medication.\n\nIn addition to all of that, what you are seeing is a biased sample. People almost never post online when everything is fine. They post when there are problems. You’re looking at a self-selected group of people with problems, not an actual random sample of all people on Metformin. \n\n> I'm really scared about this.

He's had several toes amputated already for infections so his Dr put him on a more frequent schedule for checking his feet before he ends up losing a foot.\n\nThe issue for him isn't the callus, but the blister that forms underneath and is more or less caused by the additional pressure caused by how his foot healed wrong.\n\nKeep checking your feet and ask your Dr about any concerns you have."", 'Thank you so much']"
health check ups doing more harm than good,"Im just writing this to get it off my chest, and to see if anyone else has had the same experience. Since the age of nine, when i was first diagnosed, I've gone to diabetic check ups every three months. Of course, being able to have professionals make sure all is well is amazing to have access to, but I do not feel as if these doctors know how to approach a child. My hba1c were absolutely amazing when i was younger, and i was continuously praised for my good control at these check ups. One day, my doctor decides to make a comment that has successfully stayed with me ever since. Me, a child going through puberty, had very expectedly gained a few pounds. Mind i was still at a healthy weight, good hba1c/bloodsugars, and with an active and healthy lifestyle. He decides to tell me to stop eating as much for dinner, and stop taking seconds if i happen do so. I would understand if my eating habits were unhealthy and causing issues with my t1d, but this was absolutely not the case. Having to check my weight every three months and being monitored and picked apart of all of my imperfections and mistakes lead me to become sick with a restrictive eating disorder. I voiced my wish to not be weighed, which was not respected. I understand the importance of making sure i stay fit and healthy, but i do believe that if my weight was dangerous it would show without having to weigh me. My eating disorder was obvious but no one did anything about it. They kept weighing me, making comments about how it now all of a sudden was too little, but did nothing about it. I dont know, these meetings have been a massive stress factor in my life and now that i am 18, i have decided that i no longer want to go to them. I think its insane how it works like this when this illness revolves around having a healthy relationship with food.

Insurance vs dr on insulin,"Since I lost my job, I've been using the stuff you can get without an RX at Walmart (Novolin NPH and Novolin R). I have a dosing regimen that works well for me, though the long onset of Novolin R vs Novolog or Humalog results in some fairly high spikes.

I finally have insurance again after 6 months without it. My insurance will cover Humalog pens (which I've used before). Insurance is being a pain though - they only cover 30 days unless I do mail order. My dr sent the pharmacy an rx for 2 boxes of the flexpens, but wrote it as 5 units 3x/day - I use a sliding scale and correction doses, and need significantly more than 5 per meal (he knows this). Obviously insurance kicked it back saying that's a 200 day supply.

How does your doctor write it in a way that lets you get enough? I've run into similar issues with my doctor's RXs before, it seems like he doesn't really know how to write them open ended. The pharmacy wasn't much help, insurance was beyond useless (overseas call center, so a bit of a language barrier). I doubt the pharmacy will want to break up a box, but my dosing would put me at about a box and a half for 30 days. I'm thinking if he just writes ""Use as directed"" that'll probably satisfy insurance?

Money is an issue at the moment, hence why I don't have an endocrinologist yet (and why I've been using Novolin for awhile).

UPDATE: When all else fails, nurses save the day. My dr roped his nurse into the conversation, she sent me a screenshot of her revision at the same time that she sent it to the pharmacy. Insurance approved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14kj593/insurance_vs_dr_on_insulin/,"[""Stay on it, both the doc and the  insurance company. I've had to do that with other issues.

Overestimate what you use.  20 units x 3 shots /day requires 1800 units every 30 days.  Each pen is 300 units.  You would need 6 pens every 30 days.  My pharmacy will only give me pens in multiples of 5 as they won’t break boxes so 6 pens gets me 20 pens.  Doing the math might help your doctor. I’ve done it at the pharmacy to show the pharmacist that 5 pens won’t last me, that I need 6, and she gave me 10 and fixed whatever needed to be fixed behind the scene.', 'He finally deferred to his nurse (who\'s also a NP), who writes most of my RXs for him anyway. Wish I could message her directly, but it\'s a large regional clinic system that basically forces you to use MyChart to reach your doctor. She got it straightened out today. Mostly - they\'re not allowed to write open ended RXs, so no ""Use as directed"". Insurance filled 1 box, pharmacy modified it to be a 25 day RX though.', 'I just talked to the clinic he\'s at, they\'re supposed to help him fix it (the person I talked to did equal parts ""wtf"" and ""our system shouldn\'t have even let him send it like this""). It really feels like I have to hold his hand sometimes when it comes to writing an rx, but he does know his stuff. He just sucks at writing prescriptions that wont get rejected by insurance.\n\nWorse comes to worse, the pharmacy has their own discount program - it would be $109 without insurance for the way it\'s currently written, with no chance of reimbursement from insurance since it comes up as a 200 day supply. But I\'d much rather pay my much lower copay.', 'I sent him pretty much exactly this. He said he\'ll up it to 10 units and sent the RX as 10mL total (uh... wouldn\'t that be one of the giant vials?), then asked what my plans were for long acting (uh.... doc, you prescribed me my long acting, you have it on my records). If my hand wasn\'t already broken from getting hit by a car last week, I probably would have punched a hole in the wall. I\'m sure the pharmacist is going ""what the fuck is this?"".\n\nGuess I\'m switching doctors sooner than I thought.', ""The pharmacy's have required me to have pens written as mL each pen is 3 mL, so if you need 10 pens it could be written as 30mL humalog pens, use as directed."", 'Yesterday afternoon I sent him a message asking if he could just call me - he\'s bad about reading just the first sentence of messages. Crickets. Woke up to a message from his nurse saying she got it taken care of, even sent a screenshot of how she sent it. Apparently the clinic doesn\'t allow them to write ""Use as directed"" RXs (or anything that could be considered open ended). Really wish I could reach his nurse directly (half of my visits have me just seeing her anyway - she\'s also a NP, and to be honest, much better with the whole communicating thing in general), but it\'s a large regional clinic system that uses MyChart for 99% of dr/pt communication. My insurance is also an EPO, my choices for doctors are very limited (everyone that practices with this clinic system accepts it though).\n\nInsurance still only approved only one box, but the pharmacy told me insurance won\'t approve over 30 days even if they try to round up to another box, they can\'t break boxes, etc. They modified it to reflect a 25 day RX (and billed it to insurance as such). Hopefully I\'ll be using quite a bit less of it though; with Novolin (NOT Novolog) I was having to take elephant doses at times (went through a full pen in 2 1/2 days a couple of times).\n\ntl;dr thanks for the help.']"

Stadamet 500mg/day - prediabetes,"Good morning!

I had a previous post here about one of my fasting blood glucose being 7.08 mmol/L

After my OGTT results a couple of days later, which came to around 9.41 mmol/L after two hours, the GP today has put me in prediabetic range from the previous diabetic diagnosis. 

I have been prescribed 500 mg/day for 3 months and I have been called after for another blood work. In the mean time, I have been told to reduce my weight through exercise and dietary changes.

My question is what can be the side effects from this medication? Is there any vitamin supplements I can take to counteract any vitamin levels that might go down from this.

Also my BP was checked today and it was in 130/80 range, as well as my cholestrol is elevated a little from the normal range.

Any advics on how best to make this medication and changes work best would be really helpful.

Edit: I also suffer from PCOS.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14k6v68/stadamet_500mgday_prediabetes/,"['I would suggest you begin a lower carb diet with higher healthy fats to keep you full and begin a 30 minute walk regimen everyday!\nVitamin d is important so being out in the sun also helps as well as a good vitamin c and zinc !', ""I will get the supplements you mentioned.

"A1C has been 6 for years, it finally got up to 7...advice on eating","I have always tended to run hypoglycemic. If I get the least bit hungry, I tremble (sugar shakes says grandma), get nauseous and irritable. As soon as I eat, (and usually a soda or juice helps me feel better), I get the runs, so I try not to get too hungry. I do have IBS and take a number of meds for that. Vit D is very low and on a script vitamin. 

My Dr has looked back over the last 5-6 years and sees that my a1c has gone from 6.0 to 7.0 and wants me to go on metformin. The gastric side effects are a concern but she thinks with taking them at meal times it shouldn't be a concern. 

Because of my guts, there's a lot of real healthy food that I love that I can't eat or can't have much of, for instance Kale and quinoa kill me, together or separate. Doubles me over and you can't make me eat any! Although I love them. They do not love me. Lactose intolerant, limited amounts of cheese are ok. 

Basically I eat two thick slices of sourdough bread with soy free butter for breakfast, I eat whatever the staff brings to share for lunch but mostly macaroni salad or spaghetti in the day and at home I eat more carbs. Potatoes or pasta with mixed veggies and various sauces. Bread and butter. Crackers and butter. Yes I'm a carboholic! For protein I eat (CRAVE) beef, pork and salmon when I can afford it, or beans and rice if I can't. Scrambled egg and cheese burritos are also easy meals. Everythint is easy and quick stuff because I have no energy and a lot of bone pain and other health issues.

I don't want to go on meds and I don't cook a whole lot although I could do some meal prepping or freezer meals. I don't cook because I always screw it up and it tastes awful and is a waste of money and effort.

I got a call from my doctor's office. They told me I have diabetes.,"I just got a call from the doctor's office today and the test results from my blood work came back. And they told me based on my blood sugar they told me I have diabetes.  Thankfully, it seems to have been caught early so I only have to take a pill rather than have my finger pricked but this whole thing still scares the hell out of me.

My eating habits are often I feel like the result of stress and depression.  Constantly worrying about my family and their well-being. On top of that, my dad had diabetes that eventually resulted in him having one of his feet amputated because he decided not to take better care of himself.

Type 1 diabetes is very complicated, and is not easily identified genetically because the suspected markers are numerous, and they vary significantly between patients, and nondiabetics also share the same markers.\n\nCRISPR gene editing for sickle cell patients may be about to happen. Gene editing for T1D is not happening anytime soon, and gene editing being done for T1D treatments, as far as I know, is directed at islets and beta cells that are going to be manufactured from exterior stem cell lines, with the goal of evading the immune system\'s destruction. As of today, it would be impossible to ""cure"" Type 1 diabetics by editing their own genome with CRISPR (for all the reasons below).\n\n> **Sickle cell disease is caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin-Beta gene found on chromosome 11.**\n\nhttps://www.genome.gov/Genetic-Disorders/Sickle-Cell-Disease\n\n > **The causes of type 1 diabetes are unknown, although several risk factors have been identified.** The risk of developing type 1 diabetes is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body\'s own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.\n\n> Type 1 diabetes is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body\'s own tissues and organs. For unknown reasons, in people with type 1 diabetes the immune system damages the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Damage to these cells impairs insulin production and leads to the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes.\n\n> HLA genes, including HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1, **have many variations, and individuals have a certain combination of these variations**, called a haplotype. Certain HLA haplotypes are associated with a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes, with particular combinations of HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 gene variations resulting in the highest risk. These haplotypes seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to beta cells. **However, these variants are also found in the general population, and only about 5 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop type 1 diabetes.** HLA variations account for approximately 40 percent of the genetic risk for the condition. **Other HLA variations appear to be protective** against the disease. **Additional contributors, such as environmental factors and variations in other genes, are also thought to influence the development of this complex disorder.**\n\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/type-1-diabetes/#causes\n\nYou can maybe look at TrialNet if you want to contribute to genetic research since you have a close family member.\n\n* https://www.trialnet.org/participate', '> Okay, we\'ve had ""investors"" push their interests here before, which isn\'t helpful.\n\nMannkind and Afrezza anyone?', 'Oof I shoved those out of my memory!

I’m October last year I got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I’ve been mostly on top of it since then and I’d say I manage it decently, last A1C was 6.7. The night before my diagnosis I had my first bed wetting episode, the doctor assured me however that it was due to my uncontrolled diabetes at the time. Since then once every couple of months I get another episode and I’m wondering could this still be from the diabetes or another underlying condition. Just looking for some opinions. Thanks I’m advance. I don’t know if it has any relevance but I’m a 22 years old male.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14jbt70/bed_wetting_and_type_1/,"['36 male, iv had one or two instances when my sugars were super high and I was really tired.', 'Happened to me a couple times during the first year after I was diagnosed, 27 m at the time.

You drink a lot of fluids then sleep super hard because you have no energy, then I could absolutely see it happen that way.  But if you're blood sugar had been pretty much in range all day and night and you weren't exceptionally thirsty and drinking a lot before bed that night, then I would assume it is probably unrelated to your diabetes.  \n\nBut I am not a medical professional.

Novorapid no longer available on the NHS?,"So just had a letter saying 

“Dear Patient,
Change in brand of your short acting insulin from Novorapid® to Trurapi®
We are writing to you as you are using short acting insulin aspart (also known as Novorapid®) to manage your diabetes.
The NHS now has another brand of insulin aspart available to prescribe called Trurapi®. Trurapi® is a biosimilar version of the insulin aspart contained in your current Novorapid®. It has been tested to ensure that it is equally effective and safe.
As you know, the NHS is under great financial pressure and it is extremely important that we make sure we spend public money carefully, using the better value choices, so that the NHS can afford the best care for patients. Trurapi® is much better value for the NHS to prescribe. Local diabetes experts have agreed that patients who are currently being treated with Novorapid® should be switched to Trurapi®.
We are therefore asking you to switch your insulin from:
Novorapid® Flexpen Prefilled Pens
To
Trurapi® SoloSTAR Prefilled Pens”

My new endo just won't prescribe me the needed amount of pen needles,"So I'm a bit perplexed here...

My first endo always prescribed me a amount where I could leave the pharmacy with a full backpack of those 100pc BD boxes - in other words, I always had enough needles left until my next  appointment. Just like it should be, right?

But now, I'm here with these new guys who would only prescribe me the needed amount of pen needles over their dead bodies lol. 

So it seems to be one golden rule there: **everyone only gets one box (100 pieces)**,  whether they like it or not. They have to last for 3 months. 

I can't imagine any scenario where I would get away with only 100 needles for 3 months without damaging my injection sites.

Ofc I asked him about this and I could instantly tell that he gets ask this a lot, because he didn't really liked to explain me the point behind that.

&#x200B;

So he basically said that I have to use them multiple times (like 5-6 at least?) and that my information of only using them one time and then dispose them is kinda bullshit, because a whole village in Ukraine could use one of these boxes for a whole year and would be happy with it...  

*wtf ok bro chill it was just a question*

&#x200B;

Anyway, last time I managed to get at least 2 boxes on my prescribtion, where I thought ""hm okay maybe if I use them 2-3 times it could work out"". (it starts making problems for me after 3 times)

Yeah no when I got my new prescribtion, guess what number was on it... still **1, not 2...** great. -.-

""excuse me miss, but doctor \*\*\*\* said that I would get 2 units from now on""

*""hm no it always has been one, for everyone - it's enough"".*

&#x200B;

Sorry for the storytime here... Anyway, I now ended up buying these things from my own money, although I shouldn't have to because insurence **would** pay for it. I could search for a new endo but it's pretty much the only one nearby. I know people have worse problems but this f\*\*ks me up so much honestly...

I keep mine pretty low so the overhead for preventing lows is reduced.\n\nFrom a cursory look at the history on Loop it makes probably 100 small adjustments a day, beyond the actual dosing calculations it does for me. I find it has reduced the amount of time I need to chase highs or lows for sure.', 'For Loop, a good place to start is [LoopDocs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/).', 'An actual fully closed loop does not exist yet—it would require no input from users and would function as an artificial pancreas. People talking about closed loop systems are all still talking about hybrids.', 'Perfect. Thank you!', 'No. There are people using AndroidAPS with experimental variants of the algorithm that have achieved fully closed loop (not even meal announcements). I have yet to encounter anyone using these systems with a TIR below ~75% (on par with commercial AHCL) and there are several people running in excess of 90% TIR in full closed-loop. If you’re willing to use it in “AHCL mode” 85-90% TIR is the baseline expectation. \n\nI don’t announce meals all the time (basically, only when it’s big, and only if I remember) and my TIR runs in the low 90s. \n\nWe know the difference between HCL and AHCL and FCL. It does not yet exist commercially (the iLet is the closest), but the future is now in the DIY space.', 'Do these systems incorporate glucagon or go beyond suspending insulin delivery for severe lows?', 'No. They are single-hormone systems. They use new dosing math based on how T1Ds actually dose themselves. They *DO* work best with faster insulins, but they work acceptably well even with standard Humalog/Novo(log/rapid). In fact, someone is even planning to test it with R just to see how well it works and develop a protocol for how to use the system in the event of that being the only insulin available. \n\nThere are situations where glucagon might be helpful (spontaneous exercise with appreciable IOB comes to mind), but progress is being made on detecting those situations and at least alerting the user to carb up early on if it’s going to be needed.', 'Right, but these aren’t closed loop at all—especially if they have to alert the user. That’s all I’m trying to say.', 'They are running without ANY user intervention/interaction on 95% of days. There are people who have not done any interaction with their systems (no manual boluses, no manual suspensions, etc) in well over a year. It’s as close to fully-closed as is likely achievable with SubQ insulin administration. \n\nWhat I described would be an edge case- one of a very few instances where user action might be required. \n\nCould single-hormone eventually get to never needing any interaction (at all, under any circumstances)? Yes, but it would require faster-absorbing insulin than is even in development/testing currently.']"
Metformin question,So I’ve been having nausea symptoms and vomiting a bit since the Dr increased my metformin dose from 500 mg every three days to every two.  Is this normal or something else causing the throwing up?,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/14js3lh/metformin_question/,[]
